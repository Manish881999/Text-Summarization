# Text-Summarization
### Objective <br>
The objective of this project is to develop a TensorFlow implementation for text summarization using the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) library. Text summarization aims to condense large bodies of text into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the key information. This project aims to address the need for automated summarization techniques to efficiently extract salient information from vast amounts of textual data.

### Current State-of-the-Art
The current state-of-the-art in text summarization includes various approaches such as extractive methods, abstractive methods, and neural network-based models. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly sequence-to-sequence models, have shown promising results in generating human-like summaries. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of summarization quality, coherence, and handling of diverse text types.

A survey of related published work reveals a wide range of approaches to text summarization, including traditional statistical methods, graph-based algorithms, and deep learning techniques. Recent studies have focused on leveraging neural network architectures, especially sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms, to improve the quality of generated summaries. 

### Approach
•	Collect document summarization datasets.
•	Preprocess the data by tokenizing and formatting it for input into the model.
•	Implement a sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization.
•	Train the model on a dataset consisting of document-summary pairs.
•	Optimize model parameters to minimize summarization loss function during training.

### Corpus to be Used
Utilize the News Dataset, accessible through TensorFlow's catalog, which offers unrestricted access to news articles and their corresponding human-written summaries, ideal for training and benchmarking the document summarization system.

### Deliverables
•	A functional Text summarization system capable of generating summaries from Text documents.
•	Comprehensive documentation presenting the system's architecture, implementation process, evaluation metrics, results analysis, and insights gleaned from the project.
•	A presentation summarizing the project objectives, approach, key findings, and potential implications for future research in Text summarization.
