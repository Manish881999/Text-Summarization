Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 on Friday, March 4, 2016. (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n Los Angeles police confirmed Friday morning a knife was found on the former Brentwood property of O.J. Simpson and said they are investigating a report that it was discovered years ago by a construction worker who handed it over to authorities. \\n \\n A report, published Friday by TMZ and citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said a construction worker found a knife several years ago buried on the perimeter of the former Simpson home and gave it to a police officer working security for a nearby film shoot. \\n \\n Archive: The O.J. Simpson Slow-Speed Chase On June 17, 1994, an apparently suicidal Orenthal \\\"OJ\\\" Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings led police on a 60 mile slow-speed car chase through Los Angeles and Orange counties, captivating viewers glued to television sets. Simpson had failed to surrender to police earlier in the day, when he was slated to be charged in the murders of his ex-wife and her male friend. As police closed down the freeways and 20 cruisers followed Simpson, spectators filled the freeway overpasses, many cheering him on with signs reading \\\"Go O.J.\\\" (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n The officer, now retired, was recently ordered to surrender the knife for testing by authorities after he contacted a friend at the department for information about the 1994 murder case for which Simpson stood trial, according to the report. \\n \\n LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman told NBC4 Friday morning that police are investigating the report. \\n \\n The mansion on Rockingham Avenue in Brentwood, where Simpson lived when his ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death in June 1994, was demolished by a new owner in 1998. TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the knife was found sometime from \\\"several years ago to 1998.\\\" \\n \\n The Great White Bronco Chase \\n \\n \\\"We still don't know if that's an accurate account,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n Neiman confirmed at a Friday morning news conference that an individual identified by the officer as a construction worker gave the knife to him when he was working security at a film shoot near the former Simpson estate. The officer retired in the late 1990s, but it's not clear whether the officer was retired at the time the knife was found, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"If this story is accurate, I would think an LAPD officer would know that anytime you come into contact with evidence you should submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n The officer will likely not face administrative charges because he is retired, Neiman said, adding that an investigation will determine whether criminal charges are possible. \\n \\n Life and Times: OJ Simpson \\n \\n Police became aware of the knife within the last month, but authorities did not discuss details about how they obtained the item. It has been submitted to an LAPD forensics team for examination. \\n \\n It was not clear to whom the knife belonged and authorities are attempting to determine the identity of the individual who turned it over to the officer, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"With all cases that remain open, unless there's an actual arrest or conviction to prove we've actually closed the case, the case remains open,\\\" Neiman said of the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. \\n \\n Neiman did not provide a description of the knife at the Friday news conference, but multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the knife undergoing tests is a relatively inexpensive, smaller-bladed utility blade typically used by construction workers, gardeners, landscapers or other laborers. \\n \\n The murder weapon in the case has remained a mystery. A 15-inch retractable-blade knife that Simpson bought at Ross Cutlery in downtown Los Angeles drew the interest of murder trial prosecutors, but the defense presented the knife in a preliminary hearing. Tests later showed the knife in pristine condition with no signs it had been used in the double killing. \\n \\n LAPD Discusses Knife Found at Ex-OJ Simpson Home (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n In 1998, a residential construction crew found a folding-blade knife in Simpson's former neighborhood but police said there was no evidence to show it was related to any crime. \\n \\n The mansion, where Simpson married Brown in 1985, was one of the landmarks of the murder trial. The infamous white Ford Bronco pursuit from Orange County ended in the mansion's driveway. It's also where Det. Mark Fuhrman said he found a bloody glove during the investigation into the slayings of Brown and Goldman. \\n \\n Simpson was forced to sell the Rockingham Avenue estate to comply with requirements of the civil court judgment after the criminal trial. An investment banker hired a demolition crew to raze the house and clear the way for a new mansion four years later. \\n \\n \\\"It's not my house and I could care less,\\\" Simpson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview at the time the house was demolished. \\\"I am a sentimental guy, but there's things you've got to compartmentalize.\\\" \\n \\n The former NFL and USC football star was acquitted of murder in the slayings of ex-wife and Goldman, but a civil jury found him liable. In September 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas and charged with several felonies after an armed robbery and kidnapping at a hotel in an attempt to recover sports memorabilia. \\n \\n He was sentenced to 33 years in prison. \\n \\n OJ Trial: Key Players Then and Now \\n \\n No matter what is determined through the knife investigation, Simpson cannot be tried again in the Brown-Goldman murders because of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Attorney Carl Douglas, a member of Simpson's legal team that secured the 1995 acquittal, said an investigation involving the knife would be a waste of time and money. \\n \\n \\\"I am amazed at the latest frenzy surrounding this ridiculous frenzy about some knife found on OJ's former property,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"As a proud citizen of Los Angeles, I will be offended if the Los Angeles Police Department spends one minute of city time or one dollar of the city's limited resources chasing this ridiculous, supposed lead. I hope there are other investigations more deserving of the city's resources than this failed attempt, now 22 years old. \\n \\n \\\"OJ left the house two days after the murders and never returned until October 3rd, 1995. I certainly hope the LAPD used all of the resources then to scour every inch of his property looking for relevant evidence. It is pure fantasy to believe that there's anything relevant with this knife that has now been turned over. I'd rather talk about the Easter Bunny instead.\\\" ||||| ABC News reports investigators said preliminary information indicates the knife found on O.J. Simpson's old home is not the murder weapon in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.Capt. Andrew Neiman said the Los Angeles Police Department became aware of the item within the last month. It was allegedly recovered by a citizen at the property possibly around the time the site was demolished, which was in 1998.Trent Copeland, the attorney of retired officer George Maycott described the weapon as a 5-inch buck knife covered with dirt and mud. He said there were no obvious signs of blood on the knife. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the likely real murder weapon was bigger and possibly \\\"exotic.\\\"The item was found by a construction worker at the site, and he gave it to Maycott, who was working an off-duty movie job. Maycott, retired at the time, immediately called the West Los Angeles Police Department to tell them he was handed a knife, the attorney said. The person on the phone placed Maycott on hold, and said she spoke to a supervisor who said the case was over and there was nothing they could do due to double jeopardy, according to Copeland.Authorities said the retired officer held onto the knife and kept it in a tool box for 15 years until recently.Maycott's attorney said the retired officer was buying materials at the academy and asked someone for a records number on the Simpson case. Jokingly, Maycott decided to put the number on the knife and frame it. The weapon was taken into custody on Feb. 10 and Maycott did not resist, according to Copeland.\\\"I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer - if this story is accurate as we're being told - would know that any time you come into contact with evidence that you should and shall submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\\"I don't know what the circumstances are or why that didn't happen or if that's entirely accurate or if this whole story is possibly bogus from the get-go.\\\"The police department has asked for the citizen who turned over the knife to contact them.Authorities said they were still doing testing to check whether the weapon was connected to the murders. As part of the investigation, LAPD detectives were trying to piece together the timeline of exactly when the demolition of the property started and ended, and who obtained the knife and had possession of it from then until now, according to ABC News.Neiman said double jeopardy would be in place for Simpson.Simpson, a former football player, was acquitted of murder charges in the 1994 stabbings of his ex-wife and her friend. He is currently imprisoned in Nevada for a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.Goldman's public relations firm, Garson & Wright Public Relations, Inc., released the following statement from Fred and Kim Goldman:\\\"Until the LAPD completes its investigation of the recovered knife, the validity of the knife as it relates to Ron and Nicole's murder is purely speculative. It is not a shock to our family that stories like this are making headlines again. Being a victim/survivor is an ongoing process for all those impacted. We cannot validate every claim with a discussion, as it only creates more unnecessary hype and encourages the media circus. \\\" ||||| Marcia Clark is opening up about reliving O.J.

I\\u2019m working on an album called the \\u2018Pink Print,\\u2019 but that\\u2019s not a plug, but it\\u2019s a plug.

But Minaj implying that Azalea doesn\\u2019t even write her own rhymes would make Azalea the prevailing Wizard of Oz of hip hop. Minaj basically stood up and said live, on national television, that Azalea\\u2019s act is nothing but a charade.

Azalea, who is Australian, wasn\\u2019t in time with her backing track, and, in the middle of a live performance, switched from her \\u201chip hop voice\\u201d to her real one, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, there\\u2019s something wrong with my ear.\\u201d \\n \\n Azalea is the only the second artist after the Beatles to have her first two songs occupy the top two spots on the Billboard chart simultaneously, with \\u201cFancy\\u201d at No. 1 and \\u201cProblem\\u201d at No. 2. \\u201cProblem\\u201d is by Ariana Grande but features Azalea. Minaj\\u2019s insult probably won\\u2019t do much to change that, but it\\u2019s certainly fun to talk about, especially since she provided some much-needed entertainment for a show that couldn\\u2019t seem to get its act together. \\n \\n The network saw fit to honor Lionel Richie with a lifetime achievement award, complete with a three-song tribute from John Legend, Ledisi and Yolanda Adams, and your typical talking head documentary-style commentary on the Commodores.

Now, the test will be whether Clinton can rise above the fray and focus on straight answers to outstanding questions about her handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and the private email setup she relied on while in office. \\n \\n Here\\u2019s POLITICO\\u2019s compilation of advice offered by experts of all stripes: \\n \\n Don\\u2019t lie \\n \\n It\\u2019s easy to dismiss a potential future indictment of Clinton for lying to Congress as the fantasy of a fevered conservative mind, but lawyers who prepare witnesses for Capitol Hill testimony say avoiding that unpleasant outcome would be at the top of their list. \\n \\n \\u201cThere\\u2019s a federal law saying you can\\u2019t lie to Congress and you can\\u2019t mislead Congress. It\\u2019s actually not all that unusual for congressional committees to refer people to the Justice Department for alleged false statements,\\u201d said Robert Kelner, a GOP lawyer with Covington & Burling. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to want to approach this from a political perspective and say things that will be directed to her political supporters, but there\\u2019s a tremendous tension between her political incentives and the advice she must be getting from her lawyers to be extremely factual.\\u201d \\n \\n Prosecutors coming after congressional witnesses over statements made in testimony is far from rare. Pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted in 2010 for testimony he gave about steroids in Major League Baseball. Sure, he was acquitted two years later after a trial, but who wants to go through that? \\n \\n Claims of false congressional testimony have triggered a series of criminal cases in recent years, including one against Steven Griles, a George W. Bush administration deputy secretary of the Interior who was caught up in the investigation into lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and another against former BP executive David Rainey, who was accused of understating how much oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (Griles pled guilty, while a judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Rainey.) \\n \\n There have also been calls for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to be prosecuted for answers he gave to Congress about the NSA\\u2019s then-classified phone surveillance efforts. He apologized, saying he misunderstood the question. No charges have been filed. \\n \\n The Iran-Contra scandal brought the largest flurry of lying-to-Congress charges in the past few decades, including indictments against Reagan National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Lt. Col Oliver North. Both men were convicted, but had their convictions overturned on appeal. \\n \\n So don\\u2019t shade the truth, even if tempted. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t speculate \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday won\\u2019t be her first public statements on Benghazi or on the email controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign, but she and her advisers have already encountered difficulties with claims made about the email situation that later proved incorrect. \\n \\n \\u201cHer biggest problem is inconsistent statements,\\u201d said one prominent Democratic lawyer, who asked not to be named. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the risk of any person going into a situation like this. This is the stuff of independent counsel investigations.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she began using her private Clintonemail.com account on March 18, 2009, but last month the Pentagon produced messages that she exchanged with Gen. David Petraeus on that address weeks earlier. Clinton aides said it now appears that while the server was set up on that March date, the account became active earlier. No one seems sure if or where messages from that period were stored. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s lawyer also told Congress in March that no emails from her account from her tenure as secretary of state \\u201creside on the server or any back-up systems associated with the server.\\u201d However, the FBI reportedly has recovered some of those messages, and recently, a service provider to Clinton\\u2019s information technology contractor revealed that it had back-up of some of the server's contents. \\n \\n Clinton also declared at the outset of the furor in March that she was confident there was no classified information in her account. \\u201cThere is no classified material,\\u201d she told reporters. \\u201dI\\u2019m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.\\u201d \\n \\n Now, the State Department has classified more than 400 of the emails with more to come. And the intelligence community says some contained information that was classified \\u201cTOP SECRET\\u201d or higher at the time. Clinton has since changed her stance to say nothing she received was \\u201cmarked classified.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton also has said repeatedly there\\u2019s no indication anyone tried to breach her server\\u2019s security, But a Senate committee found evidence of potential intrusions from China S. Korea and Germany after she left office but while the server still contained her email archive. \\n \\n For both political and legal reasons, Clinton needs to avoid making any more declarations that are later overtaken by the facts. \\n \\n \\u201cIn life, you never know what you don\\u2019t know, therefore you need to be careful not to go out on a limb to assert facts that are not rock solid,\\u201d said Ron Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore Law School and formerly the Justice Department\\u2019s top adviser to officials testifying on the Hill. \\n \\n Expect Clinton to deflect to others as often as she can, relaying what others told her about Benghazi or her emails. She did just this in August, submitting a declaration under penalty of perjury that appeared to certify all her work related emails had been turned over to the State Department. But on closer examination, it said simply that \\u201con information and belief\\u201d others did the review. \\n \\n Given that her emails already made public show her struggling with technology like fax machines, one easy out for Clinton will be to profess ignorance about any technical questions about her computer setup. \\n \\n \\u201cI think you will hear a lot of caveats,\\u201d Kelner said. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t rile the FBI \\n \\n The FBI team investigating potential security breaches involving Clinton\\u2019s private server will undoubtedly tune in to her testimony. Officially there\\u2019s no indication that Clinton is the target of the inquiry or even that it\\u2019s a criminal probe. \\n \\n Clinton would be wise not to follow President Barack Obama\\u2019s example of dismissing the idea that the private server posed any national security threat, lawyers said. \\u201cThis is not a situation in which America\\u2019s national security was endangered,\\u201d Obama declared recently on CBS\\u2019s \\u201c60 Minutes.\\u201d The comment reportedly angered FBI agents working on the inquiry into Clinton\\u2019s server because it seemed to prejudge the outcome of their probe. \\n \\n Experts urged Clinton to treat the classification issue seriously, even as she maintains she didn\\u2019t knowingly handle anything classified on her private account. \\n \\n \\u201cShe needs to say she takes this seriously, that this is something that needs to be looked at by the appropriate agencies and, hopefully, lessons learned are derived from this,\\u201d said Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represents intelligence agency personnel. He said Clinton can also legitimately decline to go into details about any specific cases by saying she \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t want to speak out of turn as departments argue amongst themselves about what should have been classified, then or now.\\u201d \\n \\n Don\\u2019t joke \\n \\n Clinton has already tried humor in an effort to defuse the email controversy, but that approach didn\\u2019t work out particularly well. \\n \\n \\u201cYou may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,\\u201d Clinton said during a speech to Iowa Democrats in August. \\u201cI love it.

Clinton is taking center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led... (Associated Press) \\n \\n Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, testifies from a position of political strength as her potential rival for the nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, announced Wednesday that he will not jump into the presidential race and she rides the momentum of a solid debate performance. \\n \\n In advance of her testimony, Clinton campaign released a summary that said she is appearing before the committee to honor the memory of the four Americans killed in Benghazi. The summary said Clinton will testify that Benghazi was a tragedy that must be learned from but that America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. \\n \\n \\\"To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from Benghazi,\\\" she will say, according to the summary. \\n \\n Clinton will vow to pursue a \\\"smart brand of leadership\\\" that balances diplomacy, development and defense, and will say this approach to diplomacy involves an element of risk-taking that can never be eliminated outright. \\n \\n At the same time, the Benghazi committee is on the defensive as the panel's GOP chairman scrambles to deflect comments by fellow Republicans that the inquiry is aimed at hurting Clinton's presidential bid. \\n \\n Clinton faces a formidable challenge as she tries to explain security lapses at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, the slow military response to the violence and the Obama administration's changing narrative about who was responsible for the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, and why the attacks were launched. \\n \\n In a high-stakes, day-long appearance that could solidify her hold on the Democratic nomination or raise doubts about her candidacy, Clinton also is certain to face questions about her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. \\n \\n The committee also faces a make-or-break moment. The panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, and other Republican investigators know their questioning of Clinton could revive the beleaguered panel's credibility or undermine it even further. \\n \\n A new Associated Press-Gfk poll offers solace to both sides. While the investigation into the attacks is a burning issue for Republicans but not the broader public, Americans are more likely to view the investigation as justified rather than as a political attack on Clinton, the poll finds. \\n \\n Many Americans don't have an opinion about Clinton's handling of the investigation. Four in 10 say they neither approve nor disapprove of how she has answered questions about the attack, while 20 percent approve and 37 percent disapprove. \\n \\n Americans also are divided on Clinton's emails. More than half of those polled view her use of a private server as a minor problem or no problem at all, compared with 1 in 3 who think it is a major problem. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans call it a major problem. \\n \\n Gowdy pledged in a recent interview that the hearing will be \\\"Benghazi-centric,\\\" focused on security before and during the attacks. Some questions on Clinton's emails are likely, Gowdy said, but he maintains that his approach may \\\"shock you with fairness.\\\" \\n \\n Clinton has said the use of a private server was a mistake. \\n \\n The hearing comes amid an escalating partisan feud on the 12-member committee, which has spent more than $4.5 million since its creation in May 2014. \\n \\n Democrats have complained about \\\"selective and out-of-context leaks\\\" that they said mischaracterized testimony by top Clinton aides and other witnesses. They say the panel has devolved into partisan harassment intended to hurt Clinton's bid for president. \\n \\n Gowdy and other Republicans say the panel has been and remains focused on those killed in Benghazi and on providing a definitive account of the attacks. There have been seven previous investigations. \\n \\n \\\"This has never been political for us,\\\" said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., a member of the Benghazi panel. \\\"This has always been about finding out the truth.\\\" \\n \\n While Thursday's hearing has drawn worldwide attention, \\\"the investigation isn't solely about Secretary Clinton. She's just one piece of a much larger investigation,\\\" Roby said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the committee has been a bust. \\n \\n \\\"After 17 months and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, the Select Committee on Benghazi has uncovered nothing that alters our core understanding of the facts as revealed by the other (seven) investigations,\\\" said Schiff, who has called for the committee to be disbanded. \\n \\n \\\"When you consider the committee's obsessive focus on attacking Secretary Clinton, the reason becomes quite clear: the (GOP) majority has little interest in the events in Benghazi except to the degree they can be used to diminish her standing in the polls,\\\" Schiff said. \\n \\n ___ \\n \\n Follow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| Play Facebook \\n \\n Twitter \\n \\n Embed The 4 Types of Benghazi Attack Lines That GOP Candidates Use 1:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \\n \\n By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans say they\\u2019re unsatisfied with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, according to results from a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \\n \\n But a plurality of respondents believe that the congressional investigation into the attack is unfair and politically motivated. \\n \\n And the public is essentially divided over the importance of Clinton\\u2019s private email server, with 47 percent of Americans saying it\\u2019s an important factor in deciding their vote, and another 44 percent saying it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n These findings come ahead of Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where the 2012 terrorist attack, Clinton\\u2019s private email server and allegations (even from fellow Republicans) that the committee was established to hurt Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign will all be subjects of discussion. \\n \\n The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is seen in flames after an attack that killed four Americans in 2012 while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI / Reuters \\n \\n And the findings in the poll tend to break down by party line. \\n \\n Forty-four percent of Americans say that they\\u2019re not satisfied with Clinton\\u2019s response to the Benghazi attack in 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state. That includes 77 percent of Republican respondents, 40 percent of independents but just 14 percent of Democrats. \\n \\n By contrast, 27 percent of Americans are satisfied with her response \\u2013 including 51 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents but just 6 percent of Republicans. \\n \\n Read the full poll here. \\n \\n Meanwhile, 36 percent of Americans think the current congressional investigation into the Benghazi attacks is unfair and too partisan (that includes 53 percent of Democrats); 29 percent of Americans believe it\\u2019s fair and impartial (including 50 percent of Republicans); and another 35 percent don\\u2019t know enough. \\n \\n Regarding Clinton\\u2019s private email server, 47 percent say it will be an important factor in their upcoming vote, versus 44 percent who disagree. \\n \\n And once again, these numbers are divided by party: 76 percent of Republicans believe Clinton\\u2019s private server is important to their vote, while 70 percent of Democrats say it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s general-election standing improves (slightly) \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll also finds that Clinton has slightly improved her general-election standing. She leads Republican Ben Carson by two points in a hypothetical match up, 47 percent to 45 percent. But a month ago, Carson had a one-point edge over Clinton, 46 percent to 45 percent. \\n \\n Clinton also leads Marco Rubio by one point (46 percent to 45 percent) and Ted Cruz by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). \\n \\n By comparison, Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is ahead of Carson by one point (44 percent to 43 percent), Rubio by four points (45 percent to 41 percent) and Cruz by 12 points (50 percent to 38 percent). \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll shows a generic Democrat holding a one-point advantage a generic Republican in a presidential contest, 41 percent to 40 percent; it was 38 percent to 38 percent a month ago. \\n \\n Comparing Clinton\\u2019s and Sanders\\u2019 attributes \\n \\n When Democratic primary voters were asked to judge Clinton and Sanders on several different attributes, Clinton\\u2019s top attributes in the poll were being knowledgeable and experienced to handle the presidency (88 percent gave her high marks here versus 56 percent for Sanders) and sharing your positions on issues (71 percent for Clinton, 55 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s worst attributes among Democratic voters: bringing real change to the direction of the country (58 percent give Clinton high marks here, versus 58 percent for Sanders) and being honest and straightforward (53 percent for Clinton, 72 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n And only 26 percent of all voters give Clinton high marks for being honest and straightforward, compared with 50 percent who give her bad marks -- essentially unchanged from the April NBC/WSJ poll. \\n \\n Democratic Party vs. GOP: In the mainstream or not? \\n \\n The new NBC/WSJ poll also measured which political party was in the mainstream \\u2013 or outside the mainstream \\u2013 on six different issues: \\n \\n Gay marriage: 63 percent said the Democratic Party was in the mainstream on this issue, versus just 29 percent who said that about the Republican Party; \\n \\n Abortion: 54 percent said Democrats were in the mainstream here, versus 33 percent who said Republicans; \\n \\n Climate change: 54 percent mainstream for Democrats, 30 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Immigration: 46 percent mainstream for Democrats, 43 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Fiscal issues such as taxing and spending: 47 percent mainstream for Republicans, 42 percent mainstream for Democrats; \\n \\n Guns: 51 percent mainstream for Republicans, 38 percent mainstream for Democrats. \\n \\n Obama job-approval rating: 46 percent \\n \\n Finally, the poll finds 46 percent approving of President Obama\\u2019s job, compared with 49 percent who disapprove -- it was 47 percent-47 percent a month ago. \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 of 1,000 adults (including nearly 400 via cell phone), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. ||||| Photo \\n \\n Q. What is the mission of the House Select Committee on Benghazi? \\n \\n A. The Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, Libya, as the panel is officially known, was created in May 2014 to look into what happened before, during and after the 2012 attack on two American outposts \\u2014 one belonging to the State Department, the other to the C.I.A. \\u2014 in Benghazi. Seven congressional panels had investigated the attacks, but Speaker John A. Boehner said the administration had covered up what occurred. Democrats said that Mr. Boehner created the committee to serve as a vehicle to undermine Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign. \\n \\n Mr. Boehner appointed Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor popular with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, to lead the committee. The panel received little attention until March 2015, when it was revealed that it had been given emails about Libya from a personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively relied on when she was secretary of state. \\n \\n Q. What questions will Mrs. Clinton face about the Benghazi attacks? \\n \\n A. Lawmakers are likely to focus on Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s response to early warnings of increasingly dangerous security conditions in Benghazi \\u2014 warnings that department officials failed to heed, an independent inquiry into the attack concluded in December 2012. That inquiry sharply criticized the State Department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and for relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound. But the report did not place blame on anyone higher than the level of assistant secretary. \\n \\n Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that she was briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi State Department post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. \\n \\n Q:. What do we still not know about the Benghazi attack? \\n \\n A. Republicans contend that the administration has not provided an answer about why Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser who at the time was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, went on national television the Sunday after the attacks and provided an inaccurate account about what occurred. Ms. Rice said that the attacks were spontaneously spawned by an anti-American video and were not preplanned by terrorists. Mrs. Clinton will probably be asked about the administration\\u2019s initial narrative about the attacks. And, she will likely be asked why the administration had Ms. Rice appear on television instead of the secretary herself. \\n \\n Q. If the committee is investigating the attacks, why is Mrs. Clinton going to be asked about her emails? \\n \\n A. The emails about Libya that the committee received had never been provided to any of the congressional committees that investigated the attacks. Mr. Gowdy has said that he has the right to investigate Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email arrangement because the committee\\u2019s charter calls for him to look into how the administration complied with other congressional inquiries into the incident. Mrs. Clinton and Democrats on the committee have said that Mr. Gowdy has no right to investigate her emails because they are not related to the attacks. \\n \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n \\n Q. What do the Republicans need to do for the hearing to be considered a success for them? \\n \\n A. The Republicans need to placate their base without appearing overly partisan. It is unclear if they can do both. The base would like to see the committee embarrass Mrs. Clinton and get her to make a significant gaffe or admit to some type of wrongdoing. But if the committee members appear overzealous, they will open themselves up to criticism from Democrats who will argue that the Republicans are just trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign. \\n \\n Q. If Mrs. Clinton is having a good day, what will that look like? \\n \\n A. Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s biggest challenge is to appear composed and patient during many hours of questioning. Some Democrats believe that the Republicans will spend the first several hours of the hearing asking Mrs. Clinton about the Benghazi attacks as a way to wear her down, and then question her about emails in the final round. \\n \\n The last time Mrs. Clinton testified before Congress was in 2013, when she appeared before House and Senate committees looking into the Benghazi attacks. That day, Mrs. Clinton accepted responsibility for the security lapses in Benghazi, but said that requests for additional security at the State Department outpost were not sent directly to her. At one point, she became exasperated with the questioning and said there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attacks had been characterized in their early hours. \\u201cWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\u2019\\u2019 she said, her voice rising. \\u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\\u201d \\n \\n Q. What do we still not know about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private email account? \\n \\n A. It is still unclear who at the State Department gave Mrs. Clinton approval to use a private rather than an official government account. It is also unclear why Mrs. Clinton did not hand her emails over to the State Department when she left office in 2013. ||||| Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was grilled for hours today before the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. \\n \\n Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \\n \\n Washington observers and political junkies have been fixated on this testimony for months, waiting in anticipation to see what impact it may have on her campaign. \\n \\n The testimony featured fireworks from members of congress on both sides of the aisle and left Clinton in the hot seat for around 11 hours, including breaks, beginning just after 10 a.m. and wrapping at 9 p.m. All told, she spent more than 8 hours testifying. \\n \\n Some of the strongest testimony so far, most likely to be seized upon by critics of Clinton, was the exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Jordan pointed to two emails -- the first was a note providing a readout of a call between Clinton and the Egyptian prime minister sent on Sept. 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack. The email quotes Clinton as having said, \\u201cWe know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack -- not a protest.\\u201d \\n \\n This is significant because it is new evidence, directly from Clinton, that supports Republican claims that the administration had strong reasons to believe the attack was planned well before U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on television a week later and claimed it was motivated by an anti-Islam video. \\n \\n The second email is from Clinton to Diane Reynolds, an alias used by Chelsea Clinton, on Sept. 11, the day of the attack, in which she wrote, \\u201cTwo of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group: The Ambassador, whom I handpicked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same tomorrow.\\u201d \\n \\n This email also shows she was making a direct assessment, at least in private, that this had to do with al-Qaeda and not a protest. This is important to Republicans and will serve to further their belief that much of the response to the Benghazi attack was calculated to protect Obama politically. \\n \\n Clinton had a clear response: \\u201cWhen I was speaking to the Egyptian prime minister or in the other two examples you showed, we had been told by Ansar al-Sharia [a militia group] that they took credit for it. It wasn't until about 24 more hours later that they retracted taking credit for it,\\\" she said. \\n \\n Clinton also defended herself by saying she was sorry her version of events didn\\u2019t \\\"fit your narrative.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Why didn't you just speak plain to the American people?\\\" Jordan asked. \\n \\n \\\"I did,\\\" Clinton replied. \\\"If you look at my statement, as opposed to what I was saying to the Egyptian prime minister, I did state clearly. I said it again in more detail the next morning, as did the president.\\\" \\n \\n That was just one exchange in a hearing that began with heated opening statements from Gowdy and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. Gowdy said that previous investigations into the Benghazi attack were \\u201cnot thorough\\u201d and blamed Democrats on the Benghazi Committee for not taking the current investigation seriously. \\n \\n Cummings fired back in his opening statement. \\u201cClearly, it is possible to conduct a serious, bipartisan investigation. What is impossible is for any reasonable person to continue denying that Republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive effort to derail Secretary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign,\\\" Cummings said. \\n \\n Gowdy denied those claims directly to Clinton. \\n \\n \\u201cI understand there are people, frankly, in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you,\\u201d Gowdy said. \\u201cLet me assure you it is not and let me assure you why it is not. This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during and after the attacks that killed them.\\u201d \\n \\n Gowdy said her testimony had been delayed not because they wanted to hurt her politically, but because of her private email account that made it so difficult to request her records from the State Department. \\n \\n \\u201cMadame secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email. We signed up to investigate and, therefore, honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us,\\\" Gowdy said. \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n In Clinton\\u2019s opening remarks, she reiterated that she knew Ambassador Stevens personally and was the one who asked him to serve in Libya. She said the U.S. government needs bipartisan agreement when it comes to foreign policy, despite disagreements. \\n \\n \\u201cMy challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself. Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead, to learn the right lessons, to rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Gowdy deferred to one of his colleagues and elected not to conduct the first round of questions. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Illinois, asked the first questions. He chose to focus on why the U.S. was in Libya to begin with, but the premise of his questions was lost after repeatedly interrupting himself to remark on Clinton\\u2019s use of notes. \\n \\n \\u201cI can pause while you read your notes from your staff,\\u201d Roskam said. \\n \\n Before turning on her microphone Clinton remarked that she is capable of doing more than one thing at a time. \\n \\n Later during the hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, had a contentious exchange with Clinton on a number of topics. \\n \\n Pompeo asked why no one had been fired after an attack that killed a U.S. ambassador for the first time in over 30 years. He also wanted to know why journalist Sidney Blumenthal had such good access to Clinton, while, as Pompeo alleges, those who worked for her did not share that same access. \\n \\n Clinton said Blumenthal was a friend who was simply sharing information and was not working for the U.S. government. Some of that information she passed on and some she did not, Clinton said. She later said he was not her main adviser on Libya, as many of her critics have alleged. \\n \\n Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, used email printouts as a prop, suggesting there were not enough emails about certain events leading up to the attack, eliciting a response from Clinton that most of the communication she had was not done over email. \\n \\n Rep. Martha Roby, R-Alabama, tried to pin Clinton down over a Feb. 9, 2012, email from State Department staffers that suggested Clinton was unaware if the U.S. had a presence in Benghazi at all. Clinton said the people who sent that email were not members of her staff and that they got it wrong. \\n \\n \\u201cOf course I knew we had a presence in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, used his time to attack the committee forcefully. He said the committee had an obsession over her email, evidenced by the questions so far. He attacked Gowdy\\u2019s opening statement, saying it offered no new facts, and said he didn\\u2019t think there was a need to form the committee in the first place. He criticized Roskom for using his time to ask a series of questions about why the U.S. was in Libya. \\n \\n \\u201cThat\\u2019s not about Benghazi,\\u201d Smith said, then saying to Clinton, \\u201cThey are making this about you.\\\" \\n \\n In one emotional exchange, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked Clinton what it was like \\\"to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Congressman, it's a very personally painful accusation. It has been rejected and disproven by nonpartisan dispassionate investigators,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"Nevertheless, having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me. I lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done.\\\" \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n The line of questioning about Sidney Blumenthal that erupted into fireworks between Gowdy and Cummings before the lunch break continued in the afternoon, with Republicans attempting to argue that Blumenthal had unfettered access to Clinton at all times, while someone like Ambassador Stevens did not. Clinton is strongly rejected that assertion, saying Stevens would have had a variety of ways to contact her office. \\n \\n \\\"I have said it before and I will say it again. I'll say it as many times as is necessary to respond. Chris Stevens communicated regularly with the members of my staff. He did not raise security with the members of my staff,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"I communicated with him about certain issues. He did not raise security with me. He raised security with the security professionals. Now, I know that's not the answer you want to hear because it's being asked in many different ways by committee members. But those are the facts, Mr. Chairman.\\\" \\n \\n Democrats on the committee used their time for the most part to question the integrity of the committee. Adam Smith again led the charge. \\n \\n \\u201cThe one thing said that is clearly the farthest from the truth is that this is not a prosecution,\\\" Smith said. \\\"If you listen to the other side, this is unquestionably exactly that -- a prosecution. ... If we can learn something new about what happened in Benghazi, that might be helpful, but right now this committee is not doing a service to the four people who died or their families or to preventing any of these future incidents from happening.\\u201d \\n \\n Later in the hearing, Roskam added a dramatic flare. \\n \\n \\\"What's your responsibility to Benghazi? That's my question,\\\" Roskam said. \\n \\n Clinton replied: \\\"Well, my responsibility was to be briefed and to discuss with the security experts and the policy experts whether we would have a post in Benghazi. Whether we would continue it. Whether we would make it permanent. As I said repeatedly throughout the day, no one ever recommended closing the post in Benghazi.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"No one recommended closing but you had two ambassadors that made several, several requests and here is basically what happened to their requests,\\\" Roskam said, ripping up paper in front of Clinton. \\\"They were torn up.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Well, that's just not true congressman,\\\" Clinton said. \\n \\n The lead-up to today's testimony has seen vicious political sniping from Democrats on the committee, who have seized on remarks in recent days from two Republican congressman and one former committee staffer, each of whom suggested publicly that the committee has disproportionately focused its attention on attacking Clinton. \\n \\n Gowdy has vehemently denied those claims, calling on his colleagues to \\\"shut up\\\" about what they don't know. Last Sunday, Gowdy said in an interview with CBS he plans to question Clinton about her role in denying requests to increase security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi prior to the attack. He said thousands of previously unseen emails to and from Stevens obtained by his committee will help inform those questions. \\n \\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May of 2014 with the purpose of conducting a full and complete investigation of the 2012 attack. Prior to Clinton's testimony today, the committee had held only three public hearings. Most of the testimony it has received so far has come in private sessions. \\n \\n The aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the nearby CIA annex instantly became a source of political tension. President Obama faced questions about the military response, allegations he misled the public about the nature the attack, and lax diplomatic security in a war zone, all as he awaited a vote on his reelection the following month. \\n \\n Numerous investigations and reports were written about what happened both on that night and in the lead up to the attack, and what needed to be done to ensure it wouldn't happen again. Two of the higher-profile reports were conducted by the Accountability Review Board (ARB), convened by Clinton herself who was Secretary of State at the time, and another later on by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee. \\n \\n In December of 2012, the ARB concluded that there was no protest before the attack (which the Obama administration has previously alleged), that the terrorist bore sole responsibility for the loss of life, and that \\\"systematic failures of leadership and management deficiencies\\\" at the State Department led to an \\\"inadequate\\\" security posture. \\n \\n Clinton was never directly implicated in the report. Clinton has admitted that the State Department could have done more to address security needs in Benghazi prior to the attack, but said those decisions were left to other people and she has denied any wrongdoing. \\n \\n Evan Vucci/AP Photo \\n \\n The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence focused on the CIA's response to the attack following accusations personnel on the ground were instructed to delay their response to the consulate, which was being overrun by militants less than one mile way. The report concluded that no such order had been given, despite contradictory witness accounts given by some contracted security officers who were there that night. It also concluded that a mixed group, including Al Qaeda affiliates, were responsible for the attacks. It found that there had been intelligence to support the administrations claims that the attack was borne out of a protest, but said there was early intelligence to counter that false assessment as well. The report declared itself as the \\\"definitive House statement\\\" on the Intelligence Community's involvement in the Benghazi attack. \\n \\n Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Paul Shanley, who was convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, 65 miles west of Boston, after his release from the Old Colony Correctional Center, where he served a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware. His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" security systems and to make sure every child leaves with an adult. \\u201cIt\\u2019s terrible ... that he\\u2019s moving across the street, but there\\u2019s nobody who is better to be his neighbor than me because all I do is make kids safe,\\\" Lask tells the Boston Herald. As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, the AP reports that he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender, though psychologists citing Shanley's advanced age and health issues concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. \\\"I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to ... be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,\\\" says Shanley's lawyer. \\\"Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,\\\" argues an attorney who represented dozens of Shanley's accusers.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? \\\"Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,\\\" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, \\\"the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,\\\" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)\",\n          \"\\u2013 A new UN analysis finds that at least 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, a \\\"much higher\\\" number than was expected and one that is \\\"truly shocking,\\\" says the UN human rights commissioner. The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 on Friday, March 4, 2016. (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n Los Angeles police confirmed Friday morning a knife was found on the former Brentwood property of O.J. Simpson and said they are investigating a report that it was discovered years ago by a construction worker who handed it over to authorities. \\n \\n A report, published Friday by TMZ and citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said a construction worker found a knife several years ago buried on the perimeter of the former Simpson home and gave it to a police officer working security for a nearby film shoot. \\n \\n Archive: The O.J. Simpson Slow-Speed Chase On June 17, 1994, an apparently suicidal Orenthal \\\"OJ\\\" Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings led police on a 60 mile slow-speed car chase through Los Angeles and Orange counties, captivating viewers glued to television sets. Simpson had failed to surrender to police earlier in the day, when he was slated to be charged in the murders of his ex-wife and her male friend. As police closed down the freeways and 20 cruisers followed Simpson, spectators filled the freeway overpasses, many cheering him on with signs reading \\\"Go O.J.\\\" (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n The officer, now retired, was recently ordered to surrender the knife for testing by authorities after he contacted a friend at the department for information about the 1994 murder case for which Simpson stood trial, according to the report. \\n \\n LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman told NBC4 Friday morning that police are investigating the report. \\n \\n The mansion on Rockingham Avenue in Brentwood, where Simpson lived when his ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death in June 1994, was demolished by a new owner in 1998. TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the knife was found sometime from \\\"several years ago to 1998.\\\" \\n \\n The Great White Bronco Chase \\n \\n \\\"We still don't know if that's an accurate account,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n Neiman confirmed at a Friday morning news conference that an individual identified by the officer as a construction worker gave the knife to him when he was working security at a film shoot near the former Simpson estate. The officer retired in the late 1990s, but it's not clear whether the officer was retired at the time the knife was found, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"If this story is accurate, I would think an LAPD officer would know that anytime you come into contact with evidence you should submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n The officer will likely not face administrative charges because he is retired, Neiman said, adding that an investigation will determine whether criminal charges are possible. \\n \\n Life and Times: OJ Simpson \\n \\n Police became aware of the knife within the last month, but authorities did not discuss details about how they obtained the item. It has been submitted to an LAPD forensics team for examination. \\n \\n It was not clear to whom the knife belonged and authorities are attempting to determine the identity of the individual who turned it over to the officer, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"With all cases that remain open, unless there's an actual arrest or conviction to prove we've actually closed the case, the case remains open,\\\" Neiman said of the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. \\n \\n Neiman did not provide a description of the knife at the Friday news conference, but multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the knife undergoing tests is a relatively inexpensive, smaller-bladed utility blade typically used by construction workers, gardeners, landscapers or other laborers. \\n \\n The murder weapon in the case has remained a mystery. A 15-inch retractable-blade knife that Simpson bought at Ross Cutlery in downtown Los Angeles drew the interest of murder trial prosecutors, but the defense presented the knife in a preliminary hearing. Tests later showed the knife in pristine condition with no signs it had been used in the double killing. \\n \\n LAPD Discusses Knife Found at Ex-OJ Simpson Home (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n In 1998, a residential construction crew found a folding-blade knife in Simpson's former neighborhood but police said there was no evidence to show it was related to any crime. \\n \\n The mansion, where Simpson married Brown in 1985, was one of the landmarks of the murder trial. The infamous white Ford Bronco pursuit from Orange County ended in the mansion's driveway. It's also where Det. Mark Fuhrman said he found a bloody glove during the investigation into the slayings of Brown and Goldman. \\n \\n Simpson was forced to sell the Rockingham Avenue estate to comply with requirements of the civil court judgment after the criminal trial. An investment banker hired a demolition crew to raze the house and clear the way for a new mansion four years later. \\n \\n \\\"It's not my house and I could care less,\\\" Simpson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview at the time the house was demolished. \\\"I am a sentimental guy, but there's things you've got to compartmentalize.\\\" \\n \\n The former NFL and USC football star was acquitted of murder in the slayings of ex-wife and Goldman, but a civil jury found him liable. In September 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas and charged with several felonies after an armed robbery and kidnapping at a hotel in an attempt to recover sports memorabilia. \\n \\n He was sentenced to 33 years in prison. \\n \\n OJ Trial: Key Players Then and Now \\n \\n No matter what is determined through the knife investigation, Simpson cannot be tried again in the Brown-Goldman murders because of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Attorney Carl Douglas, a member of Simpson's legal team that secured the 1995 acquittal, said an investigation involving the knife would be a waste of time and money. \\n \\n \\\"I am amazed at the latest frenzy surrounding this ridiculous frenzy about some knife found on OJ's former property,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"As a proud citizen of Los Angeles, I will be offended if the Los Angeles Police Department spends one minute of city time or one dollar of the city's limited resources chasing this ridiculous, supposed lead. I hope there are other investigations more deserving of the city's resources than this failed attempt, now 22 years old. \\n \\n \\\"OJ left the house two days after the murders and never returned until October 3rd, 1995. I certainly hope the LAPD used all of the resources then to scour every inch of his property looking for relevant evidence. It is pure fantasy to believe that there's anything relevant with this knife that has now been turned over. I'd rather talk about the Easter Bunny instead.\\\" ||||| ABC News reports investigators said preliminary information indicates the knife found on O.J. Simpson's old home is not the murder weapon in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.Capt. Andrew Neiman said the Los Angeles Police Department became aware of the item within the last month. It was allegedly recovered by a citizen at the property possibly around the time the site was demolished, which was in 1998.Trent Copeland, the attorney of retired officer George Maycott described the weapon as a 5-inch buck knife covered with dirt and mud. He said there were no obvious signs of blood on the knife. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the likely real murder weapon was bigger and possibly \\\"exotic.\\\"The item was found by a construction worker at the site, and he gave it to Maycott, who was working an off-duty movie job. Maycott, retired at the time, immediately called the West Los Angeles Police Department to tell them he was handed a knife, the attorney said. The person on the phone placed Maycott on hold, and said she spoke to a supervisor who said the case was over and there was nothing they could do due to double jeopardy, according to Copeland.Authorities said the retired officer held onto the knife and kept it in a tool box for 15 years until recently.Maycott's attorney said the retired officer was buying materials at the academy and asked someone for a records number on the Simpson case. Jokingly, Maycott decided to put the number on the knife and frame it. The weapon was taken into custody on Feb. 10 and Maycott did not resist, according to Copeland.\\\"I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer - if this story is accurate as we're being told - would know that any time you come into contact with evidence that you should and shall submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\\"I don't know what the circumstances are or why that didn't happen or if that's entirely accurate or if this whole story is possibly bogus from the get-go.\\\"The police department has asked for the citizen who turned over the knife to contact them.Authorities said they were still doing testing to check whether the weapon was connected to the murders. As part of the investigation, LAPD detectives were trying to piece together the timeline of exactly when the demolition of the property started and ended, and who obtained the knife and had possession of it from then until now, according to ABC News.Neiman said double jeopardy would be in place for Simpson.Simpson, a former football player, was acquitted of murder charges in the 1994 stabbings of his ex-wife and her friend. He is currently imprisoned in Nevada for a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.Goldman's public relations firm, Garson & Wright Public Relations, Inc., released the following statement from Fred and Kim Goldman:\\\"Until the LAPD completes its investigation of the recovered knife, the validity of the knife as it relates to Ron and Nicole's murder is purely speculative. It is not a shock to our family that stories like this are making headlines again. Being a victim/survivor is an ongoing process for all those impacted. We cannot validate every claim with a discussion, as it only creates more unnecessary hype and encourages the media circus. \\\" ||||| Marcia Clark is opening up about reliving O.J.

Azalea, who is Australian, wasn\\u2019t in time with her backing track, and, in the middle of a live performance, switched from her \\u201chip hop voice\\u201d to her real one, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, there\\u2019s something wrong with my ear.\\u201d \\n \\n Azalea is the only the second artist after the Beatles to have her first two songs occupy the top two spots on the Billboard chart simultaneously, with \\u201cFancy\\u201d at No. 1 and \\u201cProblem\\u201d at No. 2. \\u201cProblem\\u201d is by Ariana Grande but features Azalea.

Now, the test will be whether Clinton can rise above the fray and focus on straight answers to outstanding questions about her handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and the private email setup she relied on while in office. \\n \\n Here\\u2019s POLITICO\\u2019s compilation of advice offered by experts of all stripes: \\n \\n Don\\u2019t lie \\n \\n It\\u2019s easy to dismiss a potential future indictment of Clinton for lying to Congress as the fantasy of a fevered conservative mind, but lawyers who prepare witnesses for Capitol Hill testimony say avoiding that unpleasant outcome would be at the top of their list. \\n \\n \\u201cThere\\u2019s a federal law saying you can\\u2019t lie to Congress and you can\\u2019t mislead Congress. It\\u2019s actually not all that unusual for congressional committees to refer people to the Justice Department for alleged false statements,\\u201d said Robert Kelner, a GOP lawyer with Covington & Burling. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to want to approach this from a political perspective and say things that will be directed to her political supporters, but there\\u2019s a tremendous tension between her political incentives and the advice she must be getting from her lawyers to be extremely factual.\\u201d \\n \\n Prosecutors coming after congressional witnesses over statements made in testimony is far from rare. Pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted in 2010 for testimony he gave about steroids in Major League Baseball. Sure, he was acquitted two years later after a trial, but who wants to go through that? \\n \\n Claims of false congressional testimony have triggered a series of criminal cases in recent years, including one against Steven Griles, a George W. Bush administration deputy secretary of the Interior who was caught up in the investigation into lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and another against former BP executive David Rainey, who was accused of understating how much oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (Griles pled guilty, while a judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Rainey.) \\n \\n There have also been calls for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to be prosecuted for answers he gave to Congress about the NSA\\u2019s then-classified phone surveillance efforts. He apologized, saying he misunderstood the question. No charges have been filed. \\n \\n The Iran-Contra scandal brought the largest flurry of lying-to-Congress charges in the past few decades, including indictments against Reagan National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Lt. Col Oliver North. Both men were convicted, but had their convictions overturned on appeal. \\n \\n So don\\u2019t shade the truth, even if tempted. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t speculate \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday won\\u2019t be her first public statements on Benghazi or on the email controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign, but she and her advisers have already encountered difficulties with claims made about the email situation that later proved incorrect. \\n \\n \\u201cHer biggest problem is inconsistent statements,\\u201d said one prominent Democratic lawyer, who asked not to be named. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the risk of any person going into a situation like this. This is the stuff of independent counsel investigations.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she began using her private Clintonemail.com account on March 18, 2009, but last month the Pentagon produced messages that she exchanged with Gen. David Petraeus on that address weeks earlier. Clinton aides said it now appears that while the server was set up on that March date, the account became active earlier. No one seems sure if or where messages from that period were stored. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s lawyer also told Congress in March that no emails from her account from her tenure as secretary of state \\u201creside on the server or any back-up systems associated with the server.\\u201d However, the FBI reportedly has recovered some of those messages, and recently, a service provider to Clinton\\u2019s information technology contractor revealed that it had back-up of some of the server's contents. \\n \\n Clinton also declared at the outset of the furor in March that she was confident there was no classified information in her account. \\u201cThere is no classified material,\\u201d she told reporters. \\u201dI\\u2019m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.\\u201d \\n \\n Now, the State Department has classified more than 400 of the emails with more to come. And the intelligence community says some contained information that was classified \\u201cTOP SECRET\\u201d or higher at the time. Clinton has since changed her stance to say nothing she received was \\u201cmarked classified.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton also has said repeatedly there\\u2019s no indication anyone tried to breach her server\\u2019s security, But a Senate committee found evidence of potential intrusions from China S. Korea and Germany after she left office but while the server still contained her email archive. \\n \\n For both political and legal reasons, Clinton needs to avoid making any more declarations that are later overtaken by the facts. \\n \\n \\u201cIn life, you never know what you don\\u2019t know, therefore you need to be careful not to go out on a limb to assert facts that are not rock solid,\\u201d said Ron Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore Law School and formerly the Justice Department\\u2019s top adviser to officials testifying on the Hill. \\n \\n Expect Clinton to deflect to others as often as she can, relaying what others told her about Benghazi or her emails. She did just this in August, submitting a declaration under penalty of perjury that appeared to certify all her work related emails had been turned over to the State Department. But on closer examination, it said simply that \\u201con information and belief\\u201d others did the review. \\n \\n Given that her emails already made public show her struggling with technology like fax machines, one easy out for Clinton will be to profess ignorance about any technical questions about her computer setup. \\n \\n \\u201cI think you will hear a lot of caveats,\\u201d Kelner said. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t rile the FBI \\n \\n The FBI team investigating potential security breaches involving Clinton\\u2019s private server will undoubtedly tune in to her testimony. Officially there\\u2019s no indication that Clinton is the target of the inquiry or even that it\\u2019s a criminal probe. \\n \\n Clinton would be wise not to follow President Barack Obama\\u2019s example of dismissing the idea that the private server posed any national security threat, lawyers said. \\u201cThis is not a situation in which America\\u2019s national security was endangered,\\u201d Obama declared recently on CBS\\u2019s \\u201c60 Minutes.\\u201d The comment reportedly angered FBI agents working on the inquiry into Clinton\\u2019s server because it seemed to prejudge the outcome of their probe. \\n \\n Experts urged Clinton to treat the classification issue seriously, even as she maintains she didn\\u2019t knowingly handle anything classified on her private account. \\n \\n \\u201cShe needs to say she takes this seriously, that this is something that needs to be looked at by the appropriate agencies and, hopefully, lessons learned are derived from this,\\u201d said Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represents intelligence agency personnel. He said Clinton can also legitimately decline to go into details about any specific cases by saying she \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t want to speak out of turn as departments argue amongst themselves about what should have been classified, then or now.\\u201d \\n \\n Don\\u2019t joke \\n \\n Clinton has already tried humor in an effort to defuse the email controversy, but that approach didn\\u2019t work out particularly well. \\n \\n \\u201cYou may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,\\u201d Clinton said during a speech to Iowa Democrats in August. \\u201cI love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\\u201d \\n \\n Later that month, she answered with a flip response when a reporter asked whether her server was \\u201cwiped\\u201d at her direction. \\u201cLike with a cloth or something?\\u201d she replied. \\n \\n The jokes didn\\u2019t sit well with some Clinton donors and advisers, who thought she appeared to be belittling legitimate concerns about government transparency. \\n \\n Probably best to leave the jokes aside this time, particularly since the House hearing is supposed to be focused on Benghazi and the brutal deaths of four Americans. With that grim context, humor might be in poor taste. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t join the food fight \\n \\n Clinton has signaled recently that if Benghazi committee members come after her, she\\u2019s ready to throw back at them some righteous indignation. \\n \\n \\u201cLook at the situation they chose to exploit to go after me for political reasons--the death of four Americans in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said angrily on NBC earlier this month. \\u201cThis committee was set up as they have admitted for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. I would have never done that, and if I were President and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.\\u201d \\n \\n At a Senate Benghazi hearing in 2013, a frustrated outburst from Clinton grabbed headlines. \\\"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\\" Clinton said. \\\"What difference \\u2013 at this point, what difference does it make?\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign has taken a decidedly combative tone with the Benghazi panel recently, shifting away from litigating facts of the email dispute and towards heated claims that Gowdy\\u2019s effort is brazenly partisan. Clinton may choose to keep that up Thursday. But some Capitol Hill vets say rather than claiming unfairness from the witness table, she\\u2019d score more points if she lets the panel\\u2019s five Democratic members slug it out with the GOP. \\n \\n \\u201cThe witness should stand back and not get in the fray of a Congressional food fight,\\u201d Weich said. \\u201cThe Democrats on this committee are very, very adept at defending witnesses from unfair attacks\\u2026Ranking Member Cumming and his troops will do their job and protect here. She doesn\\u2019t need to be the one to raise points when her allies on the committee are ready to do so.\\u201d \\n \\n ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 After months of buildup, Hillary Rodham Clinton finally takes center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led investigation into the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. \\n \\n In this Oct. 16, 2015, photo, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during a town hall meeting in Keene, N.H. Clinton is taking center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led... (Associated Press) \\n \\n Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, testifies from a position of political strength as her potential rival for the nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, announced Wednesday that he will not jump into the presidential race and she rides the momentum of a solid debate performance. \\n \\n In advance of her testimony, Clinton campaign released a summary that said she is appearing before the committee to honor the memory of the four Americans killed in Benghazi. The summary said Clinton will testify that Benghazi was a tragedy that must be learned from but that America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. \\n \\n \\\"To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from Benghazi,\\\" she will say, according to the summary. \\n \\n Clinton will vow to pursue a \\\"smart brand of leadership\\\" that balances diplomacy, development and defense, and will say this approach to diplomacy involves an element of risk-taking that can never be eliminated outright. \\n \\n At the same time, the Benghazi committee is on the defensive as the panel's GOP chairman scrambles to deflect comments by fellow Republicans that the inquiry is aimed at hurting Clinton's presidential bid. \\n \\n Clinton faces a formidable challenge as she tries to explain security lapses at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, the slow military response to the violence and the Obama administration's changing narrative about who was responsible for the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, and why the attacks were launched. \\n \\n In a high-stakes, day-long appearance that could solidify her hold on the Democratic nomination or raise doubts about her candidacy, Clinton also is certain to face questions about her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. \\n \\n The committee also faces a make-or-break moment. The panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, and other Republican investigators know their questioning of Clinton could revive the beleaguered panel's credibility or undermine it even further. \\n \\n A new Associated Press-Gfk poll offers solace to both sides. While the investigation into the attacks is a burning issue for Republicans but not the broader public, Americans are more likely to view the investigation as justified rather than as a political attack on Clinton, the poll finds. \\n \\n Many Americans don't have an opinion about Clinton's handling of the investigation. Four in 10 say they neither approve nor disapprove of how she has answered questions about the attack, while 20 percent approve and 37 percent disapprove. \\n \\n Americans also are divided on Clinton's emails. More than half of those polled view her use of a private server as a minor problem or no problem at all, compared with 1 in 3 who think it is a major problem. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans call it a major problem. \\n \\n Gowdy pledged in a recent interview that the hearing will be \\\"Benghazi-centric,\\\" focused on security before and during the attacks. Some questions on Clinton's emails are likely, Gowdy said, but he maintains that his approach may \\\"shock you with fairness.\\\" \\n \\n Clinton has said the use of a private server was a mistake. \\n \\n The hearing comes amid an escalating partisan feud on the 12-member committee, which has spent more than $4.5 million since its creation in May 2014. \\n \\n Democrats have complained about \\\"selective and out-of-context leaks\\\" that they said mischaracterized testimony by top Clinton aides and other witnesses. They say the panel has devolved into partisan harassment intended to hurt Clinton's bid for president. \\n \\n Gowdy and other Republicans say the panel has been and remains focused on those killed in Benghazi and on providing a definitive account of the attacks. There have been seven previous investigations. \\n \\n \\\"This has never been political for us,\\\" said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., a member of the Benghazi panel. \\\"This has always been about finding out the truth.\\\" \\n \\n While Thursday's hearing has drawn worldwide attention, \\\"the investigation isn't solely about Secretary Clinton. She's just one piece of a much larger investigation,\\\" Roby said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the committee has been a bust. \\n \\n \\\"After 17 months and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, the Select Committee on Benghazi has uncovered nothing that alters our core understanding of the facts as revealed by the other (seven) investigations,\\\" said Schiff, who has called for the committee to be disbanded. \\n \\n \\\"When you consider the committee's obsessive focus on attacking Secretary Clinton, the reason becomes quite clear: the (GOP) majority has little interest in the events in Benghazi except to the degree they can be used to diminish her standing in the polls,\\\" Schiff said. \\n \\n ___ \\n \\n Follow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| Play Facebook \\n \\n Twitter \\n \\n Embed The 4 Types of Benghazi Attack Lines That GOP Candidates Use 1:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \\n \\n By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans say they\\u2019re unsatisfied with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, according to results from a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \\n \\n But a plurality of respondents believe that the congressional investigation into the attack is unfair and politically motivated. \\n \\n And the public is essentially divided over the importance of Clinton\\u2019s private email server, with 47 percent of Americans saying it\\u2019s an important factor in deciding their vote, and another 44 percent saying it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n These findings come ahead of Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where the 2012 terrorist attack, Clinton\\u2019s private email server and allegations (even from fellow Republicans) that the committee was established to hurt Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign will all be subjects of discussion. \\n \\n The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is seen in flames after an attack that killed four Americans in 2012 while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI / Reuters \\n \\n And the findings in the poll tend to break down by party line. \\n \\n Forty-four percent of Americans say that they\\u2019re not satisfied with Clinton\\u2019s response to the Benghazi attack in 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state. That includes 77 percent of Republican respondents, 40 percent of independents but just 14 percent of Democrats. \\n \\n By contrast, 27 percent of Americans are satisfied with her response \\u2013 including 51 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents but just 6 percent of Republicans. \\n \\n Read the full poll here. \\n \\n Meanwhile, 36 percent of Americans think the current congressional investigation into the Benghazi attacks is unfair and too partisan (that includes 53 percent of Democrats); 29 percent of Americans believe it\\u2019s fair and impartial (including 50 percent of Republicans); and another 35 percent don\\u2019t know enough. \\n \\n Regarding Clinton\\u2019s private email server, 47 percent say it will be an important factor in their upcoming vote, versus 44 percent who disagree. \\n \\n And once again, these numbers are divided by party: 76 percent of Republicans believe Clinton\\u2019s private server is important to their vote, while 70 percent of Democrats say it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s general-election standing improves (slightly) \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll also finds that Clinton has slightly improved her general-election standing. She leads Republican Ben Carson by two points in a hypothetical match up, 47 percent to 45 percent. But a month ago, Carson had a one-point edge over Clinton, 46 percent to 45 percent. \\n \\n Clinton also leads Marco Rubio by one point (46 percent to 45 percent) and Ted Cruz by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). \\n \\n By comparison, Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is ahead of Carson by one point (44 percent to 43 percent), Rubio by four points (45 percent to 41 percent) and Cruz by 12 points (50 percent to 38 percent). \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll shows a generic Democrat holding a one-point advantage a generic Republican in a presidential contest, 41 percent to 40 percent; it was 38 percent to 38 percent a month ago. \\n \\n Comparing Clinton\\u2019s and Sanders\\u2019 attributes \\n \\n When Democratic primary voters were asked to judge Clinton and Sanders on several different attributes, Clinton\\u2019s top attributes in the poll were being knowledgeable and experienced to handle the presidency (88 percent gave her high marks here versus 56 percent for Sanders) and sharing your positions on issues (71 percent for Clinton, 55 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s worst attributes among Democratic voters: bringing real change to the direction of the country (58 percent give Clinton high marks here, versus 58 percent for Sanders) and being honest and straightforward (53 percent for Clinton, 72 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n And only 26 percent of all voters give Clinton high marks for being honest and straightforward, compared with 50 percent who give her bad marks -- essentially unchanged from the April NBC/WSJ poll. \\n \\n Democratic Party vs. GOP: In the mainstream or not? \\n \\n The new NBC/WSJ poll also measured which political party was in the mainstream \\u2013 or outside the mainstream \\u2013 on six different issues: \\n \\n Gay marriage: 63 percent said the Democratic Party was in the mainstream on this issue, versus just 29 percent who said that about the Republican Party; \\n \\n Abortion: 54 percent said Democrats were in the mainstream here, versus 33 percent who said Republicans; \\n \\n Climate change: 54 percent mainstream for Democrats, 30 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Immigration: 46 percent mainstream for Democrats, 43 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Fiscal issues such as taxing and spending: 47 percent mainstream for Republicans, 42 percent mainstream for Democrats; \\n \\n Guns: 51 percent mainstream for Republicans, 38 percent mainstream for Democrats. \\n \\n Obama job-approval rating: 46 percent \\n \\n Finally, the poll finds 46 percent approving of President Obama\\u2019s job, compared with 49 percent who disapprove -- it was 47 percent-47 percent a month ago. \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 of 1,000 adults (including nearly 400 via cell phone), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. ||||| Photo \\n \\n Q. What is the mission of the House Select Committee on Benghazi? \\n \\n A. The Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, Libya, as the panel is officially known, was created in May 2014 to look into what happened before, during and after the 2012 attack on two American outposts \\u2014 one belonging to the State Department, the other to the C.I.A. \\u2014 in Benghazi. Seven congressional panels had investigated the attacks, but Speaker John A. Boehner said the administration had covered up what occurred. Democrats said that Mr. Boehner created the committee to serve as a vehicle to undermine Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign. \\n \\n Mr. Boehner appointed Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor popular with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, to lead the committee. The panel received little attention until March 2015, when it was revealed that it had been given emails about Libya from a personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively relied on when she was secretary of state. \\n \\n Q. What questions will Mrs. Clinton face about the Benghazi attacks? \\n \\n A. Lawmakers are likely to focus on Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s response to early warnings of increasingly dangerous security conditions in Benghazi \\u2014 warnings that department officials failed to heed, an independent inquiry into the attack concluded in December 2012. That inquiry sharply criticized the State Department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and for relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound. But the report did not place blame on anyone higher than the level of assistant secretary. \\n \\n Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that she was briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi State Department post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. \\n \\n Q:. What do we still not know about the Benghazi attack? \\n \\n A. Republicans contend that the administration has not provided an answer about why Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser who at the time was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, went on national television the Sunday after the attacks and provided an inaccurate account about what occurred. Ms. Rice said that the attacks were spontaneously spawned by an anti-American video and were not preplanned by terrorists. Mrs. Clinton will probably be asked about the administration\\u2019s initial narrative about the attacks. And, she will likely be asked why the administration had Ms. Rice appear on television instead of the secretary herself. \\n \\n Q. If the committee is investigating the attacks, why is Mrs. Clinton going to be asked about her emails? \\n \\n A. The emails about Libya that the committee received had never been provided to any of the congressional committees that investigated the attacks. Mr. Gowdy has said that he has the right to investigate Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email arrangement because the committee\\u2019s charter calls for him to look into how the administration complied with other congressional inquiries into the incident. Mrs. Clinton and Democrats on the committee have said that Mr. Gowdy has no right to investigate her emails because they are not related to the attacks. \\n \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n \\n Q. What do the Republicans need to do for the hearing to be considered a success for them? \\n \\n A. The Republicans need to placate their base without appearing overly partisan. It is unclear if they can do both. The base would like to see the committee embarrass Mrs. Clinton and get her to make a significant gaffe or admit to some type of wrongdoing. But if the committee members appear overzealous, they will open themselves up to criticism from Democrats who will argue that the Republicans are just trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign. \\n \\n Q. If Mrs. Clinton is having a good day, what will that look like? \\n \\n A. Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s biggest challenge is to appear composed and patient during many hours of questioning. Some Democrats believe that the Republicans will spend the first several hours of the hearing asking Mrs. Clinton about the Benghazi attacks as a way to wear her down, and then question her about emails in the final round. \\n \\n The last time Mrs. Clinton testified before Congress was in 2013, when she appeared before House and Senate committees looking into the Benghazi attacks. That day, Mrs. Clinton accepted responsibility for the security lapses in Benghazi, but said that requests for additional security at the State Department outpost were not sent directly to her. At one point, she became exasperated with the questioning and said there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attacks had been characterized in their early hours. \\u201cWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\u2019\\u2019 she said, her voice rising. \\u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\\u201d \\n \\n Q. What do we still not know about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private email account? \\n \\n A. It is still unclear who at the State Department gave Mrs. Clinton approval to use a private rather than an official government account. It is also unclear why Mrs. Clinton did not hand her emails over to the State Department when she left office in 2013. ||||| Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was grilled for hours today before the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. \\n \\n Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \\n \\n Washington observers and political junkies have been fixated on this testimony for months, waiting in anticipation to see what impact it may have on her campaign. \\n \\n The testimony featured fireworks from members of congress on both sides of the aisle and left Clinton in the hot seat for around 11 hours, including breaks, beginning just after 10 a.m. and wrapping at 9 p.m. All told, she spent more than 8 hours testifying. \\n \\n Some of the strongest testimony so far, most likely to be seized upon by critics of Clinton, was the exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Jordan pointed to two emails -- the first was a note providing a readout of a call between Clinton and the Egyptian prime minister sent on Sept. 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack. The email quotes Clinton as having said, \\u201cWe know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack -- not a protest.\\u201d \\n \\n This is significant because it is new evidence, directly from Clinton, that supports Republican claims that the administration had strong reasons to believe the attack was planned well before U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on television a week later and claimed it was motivated by an anti-Islam video. \\n \\n The second email is from Clinton to Diane Reynolds, an alias used by Chelsea Clinton, on Sept. 11, the day of the attack, in which she wrote, \\u201cTwo of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group: The Ambassador, whom I handpicked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same tomorrow.\\u201d \\n \\n This email also shows she was making a direct assessment, at least in private, that this had to do with al-Qaeda and not a protest. This is important to Republicans and will serve to further their belief that much of the response to the Benghazi attack was calculated to protect Obama politically. \\n \\n Clinton had a clear response: \\u201cWhen I was speaking to the Egyptian prime minister or in the other two examples you showed, we had been told by Ansar al-Sharia [a militia group] that they took credit for it. It wasn't until about 24 more hours later that they retracted taking credit for it,\\\" she said. \\n \\n Clinton also defended herself by saying she was sorry her version of events didn\\u2019t \\\"fit your narrative.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Why didn't you just speak plain to the American people?\\\" Jordan asked. \\n \\n \\\"I did,\\\" Clinton replied. \\\"If you look at my statement, as opposed to what I was saying to the Egyptian prime minister, I did state clearly. I said it again in more detail the next morning, as did the president.\\\" \\n \\n That was just one exchange in a hearing that began with heated opening statements from Gowdy and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. Gowdy said that previous investigations into the Benghazi attack were \\u201cnot thorough\\u201d and blamed Democrats on the Benghazi Committee for not taking the current investigation seriously. \\n \\n Cummings fired back in his opening statement. \\u201cClearly, it is possible to conduct a serious, bipartisan investigation. What is impossible is for any reasonable person to continue denying that Republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive effort to derail Secretary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign,\\\" Cummings said. \\n \\n Gowdy denied those claims directly to Clinton. \\n \\n \\u201cI understand there are people, frankly, in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you,\\u201d Gowdy said. \\u201cLet me assure you it is not and let me assure you why it is not. This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during and after the attacks that killed them.\\u201d \\n \\n Gowdy said her testimony had been delayed not because they wanted to hurt her politically, but because of her private email account that made it so difficult to request her records from the State Department. \\n \\n \\u201cMadame secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email. We signed up to investigate and, therefore, honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us,\\\" Gowdy said. \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n In Clinton\\u2019s opening remarks, she reiterated that she knew Ambassador Stevens personally and was the one who asked him to serve in Libya. She said the U.S. government needs bipartisan agreement when it comes to foreign policy, despite disagreements. \\n \\n \\u201cMy challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself. Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead, to learn the right lessons, to rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Gowdy deferred to one of his colleagues and elected not to conduct the first round of questions. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Illinois, asked the first questions. He chose to focus on why the U.S. was in Libya to begin with, but the premise of his questions was lost after repeatedly interrupting himself to remark on Clinton\\u2019s use of notes. \\n \\n \\u201cI can pause while you read your notes from your staff,\\u201d Roskam said. \\n \\n Before turning on her microphone Clinton remarked that she is capable of doing more than one thing at a time. \\n \\n Later during the hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, had a contentious exchange with Clinton on a number of topics. \\n \\n Pompeo asked why no one had been fired after an attack that killed a U.S. ambassador for the first time in over 30 years. He also wanted to know why journalist Sidney Blumenthal had such good access to Clinton, while, as Pompeo alleges, those who worked for her did not share that same access. \\n \\n Clinton said Blumenthal was a friend who was simply sharing information and was not working for the U.S. government. Some of that information she passed on and some she did not, Clinton said. She later said he was not her main adviser on Libya, as many of her critics have alleged. \\n \\n Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, used email printouts as a prop, suggesting there were not enough emails about certain events leading up to the attack, eliciting a response from Clinton that most of the communication she had was not done over email. \\n \\n Rep. Martha Roby, R-Alabama, tried to pin Clinton down over a Feb. 9, 2012, email from State Department staffers that suggested Clinton was unaware if the U.S. had a presence in Benghazi at all. Clinton said the people who sent that email were not members of her staff and that they got it wrong. \\n \\n \\u201cOf course I knew we had a presence in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, used his time to attack the committee forcefully. He said the committee had an obsession over her email, evidenced by the questions so far. He attacked Gowdy\\u2019s opening statement, saying it offered no new facts, and said he didn\\u2019t think there was a need to form the committee in the first place. He criticized Roskom for using his time to ask a series of questions about why the U.S. was in Libya. \\n \\n \\u201cThat\\u2019s not about Benghazi,\\u201d Smith said, then saying to Clinton, \\u201cThey are making this about you.\\\" \\n \\n In one emotional exchange, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked Clinton what it was like \\\"to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Congressman, it's a very personally painful accusation. It has been rejected and disproven by nonpartisan dispassionate investigators,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"Nevertheless, having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me. I lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done.\\\" \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n The line of questioning about Sidney Blumenthal that erupted into fireworks between Gowdy and Cummings before the lunch break continued in the afternoon, with Republicans attempting to argue that Blumenthal had unfettered access to Clinton at all times, while someone like Ambassador Stevens did not. Clinton is strongly rejected that assertion, saying Stevens would have had a variety of ways to contact her office. \\n \\n \\\"I have said it before and I will say it again. I'll say it as many times as is necessary to respond. Chris Stevens communicated regularly with the members of my staff. He did not raise security with the members of my staff,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"I communicated with him about certain issues. He did not raise security with me. He raised security with the security professionals. Now, I know that's not the answer you want to hear because it's being asked in many different ways by committee members. But those are the facts, Mr. Chairman.\\\" \\n \\n Democrats on the committee used their time for the most part to question the integrity of the committee. Adam Smith again led the charge. \\n \\n \\u201cThe one thing said that is clearly the farthest from the truth is that this is not a prosecution,\\\" Smith said. \\\"If you listen to the other side, this is unquestionably exactly that -- a prosecution. ... If we can learn something new about what happened in Benghazi, that might be helpful, but right now this committee is not doing a service to the four people who died or their families or to preventing any of these future incidents from happening.\\u201d \\n \\n Later in the hearing, Roskam added a dramatic flare. \\n \\n \\\"What's your responsibility to Benghazi? That's my question,\\\" Roskam said. \\n \\n Clinton replied: \\\"Well, my responsibility was to be briefed and to discuss with the security experts and the policy experts whether we would have a post in Benghazi. Whether we would continue it. Whether we would make it permanent. As I said repeatedly throughout the day, no one ever recommended closing the post in Benghazi.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"No one recommended closing but you had two ambassadors that made several, several requests and here is basically what happened to their requests,\\\" Roskam said, ripping up paper in front of Clinton. \\\"They were torn up.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Well, that's just not true congressman,\\\" Clinton said. \\n \\n The lead-up to today's testimony has seen vicious political sniping from Democrats on the committee, who have seized on remarks in recent days from two Republican congressman and one former committee staffer, each of whom suggested publicly that the committee has disproportionately focused its attention on attacking Clinton. \\n \\n Gowdy has vehemently denied those claims, calling on his colleagues to \\\"shut up\\\" about what they don't know. Last Sunday, Gowdy said in an interview with CBS he plans to question Clinton about her role in denying requests to increase security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi prior to the attack. He said thousands of previously unseen emails to and from Stevens obtained by his committee will help inform those questions. \\n \\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May of 2014 with the purpose of conducting a full and complete investigation of the 2012 attack. Prior to Clinton's testimony today, the committee had held only three public hearings. Most of the testimony it has received so far has come in private sessions. \\n \\n The aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the nearby CIA annex instantly became a source of political tension. President Obama faced questions about the military response, allegations he misled the public about the nature the attack, and lax diplomatic security in a war zone, all as he awaited a vote on his reelection the following month. \\n \\n Numerous investigations and reports were written about what happened both on that night and in the lead up to the attack, and what needed to be done to ensure it wouldn't happen again. Two of the higher-profile reports were conducted by the Accountability Review Board (ARB), convened by Clinton herself who was Secretary of State at the time, and another later on by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee. \\n \\n In December of 2012, the ARB concluded that there was no protest before the attack (which the Obama administration has previously alleged), that the terrorist bore sole responsibility for the loss of life, and that \\\"systematic failures of leadership and management deficiencies\\\" at the State Department led to an \\\"inadequate\\\" security posture. \\n \\n Clinton was never directly implicated in the report. Clinton has admitted that the State Department could have done more to address security needs in Benghazi prior to the attack, but said those decisions were left to other people and she has denied any wrongdoing. \\n \\n Evan Vucci/AP Photo \\n \\n The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence focused on the CIA's response to the attack following accusations personnel on the ground were instructed to delay their response to the consulate, which was being overrun by militants less than one mile way. The report concluded that no such order had been given, despite contradictory witness accounts given by some contracted security officers who were there that night. It also concluded that a mixed group, including Al Qaeda affiliates, were responsible for the attacks. It found that there had been intelligence to support the administrations claims that the attack was borne out of a protest, but said there was early intelligence to counter that false assessment as well. The report declared itself as the \\\"definitive House statement\\\" on the Intelligence Community's involvement in the Benghazi attack. \\n \\n Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Paul Shanley, who was convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, 65 miles west of Boston, after his release from the Old Colony Correctional Center, where he served a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware. His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" security systems and to make sure every child leaves with an adult. \\u201cIt\\u2019s terrible ... that he\\u2019s moving across the street, but there\\u2019s nobody who is better to be his neighbor than me because all I do is make kids safe,\\\" Lask tells the Boston Herald. As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, the AP reports that he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender, though psychologists citing Shanley's advanced age and health issues concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. \\\"I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to ... be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,\\\" says Shanley's lawyer. \\\"Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,\\\" argues an attorney who represented dozens of Shanley's accusers.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? \\\"Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,\\\" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, \\\"the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,\\\" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)\",\n          \"\\u2013 A new UN analysis finds that at least 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, a \\\"much higher\\\" number than was expected and one that is \\\"truly shocking,\\\" says the UN human rights commissioner. The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n

The identities of special forces personnel can be classified in certain circumstances and making them public is against the law, according to experts. \\n \\n Vickers, a former Army special forces operator and onetime CIA paramilitary officer, is the top intelligence adviser to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and oversees the Pentagon\\u2019s vast intelligence operations. He\\u2019s been frequently mentioned as a candidate to replace retired Army Gen. David Petraeus as CIA director. \\n \\n \\u201cMike Vickers is an outstanding defense and intelligence professional and is well respected inside the Department of Defense and the intelligence community,\\u201d Pentagon spokesman George Little said. \\n \\n It was unclear whether the Justice Department review could hurt Vickers\\u2019 chances of being nominated to the CIA post. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the matter. \\n \\n \\u201cWhen it comes to even the slightest hint that there may have been an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, there\\u2019s actually little choice but to contact Justice,\\u201d a senior defense official said. \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t mean they will do anything with it. This is a routine practice.\\u201d \\n \\n The Pentagon inspector general\\u2019s office is continuing to examine whether there were any other leaks of restricted information to the makers of the film. In a Dec. 4 letter denying a McClatchy Freedom of Information Act request for the findings, the office said the material was \\u201ccurrently part of an open investigation.\\u201d A spokeswoman said Monday that the report \\u201chas not yet been finalized and issued.\\u201d \\n \\n Even though the inquiry was launched at the request of Rep. Peter King, R-NY, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, the Defense Department Inspector General\\u2019s Office hadn\\u2019t informed King or any other lawmaker of its findings by midday Monday, a politically risky decision that could ignite charges that officials were trying to protect President Barack Obama during his tough re-election battle. \\n \\n King told McClatchy that the delay in notifying him \\u201craises the question\\u201d of whether officials were trying to put it off for political reasons, but he wanted to see the full report before drawing any conclusions. \\n \\n \\u201cI\\u2019m not looking for anyone to be indicted,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut the IG does not make referrals to the Justice Department as a matter of routine. To me the fact that any information at all would be given to Hollywood producers by this administration is disgraceful.\\u201d \\n \\n \\u201cIf it\\u2019s wrong enough or questionable enough for the IG to refer it to the Justice Department, that means it shouldn\\u2019t have been done.\\u201d \\n \\n The film, by director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, originally was set for release just weeks before the Nov. 6 election. But it was delayed amid Republican complaints that it could bring Obama votes by glorifying the bin Laden operation. The premier was held last week and the film is due for a limited public release on Wednesday. \\n \\n The senior defense official, who requested anonymity because he wasn\\u2019t authorized to discuss the matter publicly, wrote in an email that Pentagon officials don\\u2019t think the case \\u201cwill amount to anything.\\u201d He pointed out that the Pentagon deemed as \\u201cunclassified\\u201d a transcript of a July 15, 2011, conversation among Vickers, Bigelow and Boal in which Vickers identified the U.S. special forces planner by name as someone who could be made available to brief the filmmakers. The transcript was released to Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog organization, in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. \\n \\n The investigators found no evidence that White House officials were involved in any leaks of classified materials to the filmmakers, according to U.S. officials familiar with the findings. They reached that conclusion, however, without interviewing any White House officials or Panetta, who was the CIA director at the time of the bin Laden raid. Panetta reassured Congress in June \\u2014 before the investigators reached their findings \\u2014 that no classified information had been released to the filmmakers. \\n \\n A second U.S. official blamed bureaucratic handwringing for the delay in notifying King, not an orchestrated effort to protect the White House. \\n \\n \\u201cThis does not appear to be a cover-up or a wag-the-dog media stunt,\\u201d the U.S. official said. \\u201cRather, this is about who gets to break the law and leak information for their own benefit.\\u201d \\n \\n (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) \\n \\n The case is emblematic of an ongoing debate over what information the government deems to be secret, who can disclose classified material and to what degree leaks of such information jeopardize national security. \\n \\n Obama\\u2019s Justice Department has prosecuted a record number of U.S. officials for leaking secret information to the news media that critics contend shouldn\\u2019t have been classified or did no harm to national security. The most prominent case involves the ongoing prosecution of Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who\\u2019s accused of providing thousands of secret and confidential diplomatic and military documents to WikiLeaks, the online whistle-blowing organization. \\n \\n In a Dec. 6 report, a presidential advisory panel that studied the classification issue found that \\u201cthe current classification system is fraught with problems. In its mission to support national security, it keeps too many secrets, and keeps them too long; it is overly complex; it obstructs desirable information sharing inside of government and with the public.\\u201d \\n \\n \\u201cA culture persists that defaults to the avoidance of risk rather than its proper management,\\u201d the Public Interest Declassification Board said in recommending an extensive overhaul of the system. \\n \\n Steven Aftergood, who runs the Federation of American Scientists\\u2019 Project on Government Secrecy, said the release of the U.S. special forces planner\\u2019s identity \\u201cwould most likely be considered sensitive, not for national security reasons, but for personal security reasons. If his name became public, it might raise security considerations for him as an individual.\\u201d \\n \\n \\u201cThe boundaries of what is and what is not classified are soft and changeable. In the abstract, this person\\u2019s identity might be sensitive but unclassified,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard to say categorically that such information either would not or would be classified.\\u201d \\n \\n King requested the investigation in August 2011 over concerns that classified information may have been given to the makers of the bin Laden movie that might have compromised tactics used by U.S. special forces and the methods used by the CIA to gather intelligence. \\n \\n Bigelow has said that \\u201cto the best of our knowledge\\u201d she and Boal didn\\u2019t receive classified information. \\u201cWe never requested classified information or was I aware that classified information was coming my way,\\u201d she said in an interview with CBS earlier this month. \\n \\n Among its other conclusions, the Pentagon investigators determined that White House and Pentagon officials discussed allowing the filmmakers to interview Vickers. They also found that the meeting with the special operations planner never took place, and that no secret special operations tactics and techniques were revealed to the pair. \\n \\n One of the filmmakers attended a June 2011 CIA award ceremony that recognized the Navy SEALs and CIA officers involved in the raid, but no effort was made to protect the special operators\\u2019 identities, investigators found. \\n \\n The investigation will create more controversy for the movie, which had its premiere Dec. 10 in Los Angeles to widespread acclaim. Human right groups and other critics are complaining that scenes of the CIA\\u2019s brutal interrogation of al Qaida detainees erroneously imply that torture provided crucial intelligence that led the agency to bin Laden\\u2019s hiding place in Abbottabad, Pakistan. \\n \\n King requested the investigation in letters to the Pentagon and CIA inspectors general in which he cited a New York Times report that Bigelow and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. were given \\u201ctop-level access to the most classified mission in history.\\u201d He also noted Bigelow\\u2019s reported attendance at the CIA ceremony. \\n \\n King asked the inspectors general to examine whether there had been any consultations between White House, Defense Department and CIA officials on providing the filmmakers access to SEAL team members or undercover CIA officers. He also requested that they look at whether any secret techniques or tactics of the SEALs or the CIA had been compromised and whether leaks about details of the raid to the news media had hurt the CIA\\u2019s intelligence collection methods or human sources. \\n \\n The Pentagon Inspector General\\u2019s Office informed King in December 2011 that it was launching a formal investigation \\u201cinto actions taken by Defense Department personnel related to the release of information to the filmmakers.\\u201d The CIA Inspector General\\u2019s Office apparently declined to investigate, telling King in a Nov. 8, 2011, letter that the agency\\u2019s Office of Public Affairs was developing a written policy \\u201cthat will govern future interactions with the entertainment industry.\\u201d \\n \\n In a May 23 letter, King wrote to Vickers that documents obtained by Judicial Watch in its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit \\u201craise serious questions regarding your central role in providing classified and sensitive information to individuals without appropriate security clearances.\\u201d The documents included emails and the transcript of the conversation that Vickers had with Bigelow and Boal in which Vickers disclosed the name of the U.S. Special Operations Command planner. \\n \\n In a separate letter the same day, King expressed concerns to CIA Deputy Director Michael J. Morell about his role in the case. Morell became the acting agency chief after Petraeus resigned last month, and his name is among those mentioned as a top contender to replace Petraeus. \\n \\n In his letter to Morell, King said the Judicial Watch documents showed that the CIA had given Bigelow and Boal permission to visit at least six CIA facilities. They included secure vaults at the National Counterterrorism Center and possibly \\u201ca sensitive, covered facility\\u201d outside the CIA headquarters campus in Langley, Va., King wrote. \\n \\n The issue provided fodder during Obama\\u2019s election battle against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, with a group of politically conservative former special forces officers producing a video in which they accused the president of taking too much credit for bin Laden\\u2019s death and allowing too many leaks of secret information about the hunt. \\n \\n (email: mtaylormcclatchydc.com, jlandaymcclatchydc.com) \\n \\n 12-17-12 \\n \\n ja-ba AMX-2012-12-17T18:56:00-05:00 ||||| Sources tell ABC News that the Inspector General for the Department of Defense has been preparing a report in which Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers is criticized for giving sensitive information to the filmmakers behind \\\" Zero Dark Thirty.\\\" \\n \\n Specifically, Vickers is said to have disclosed to the filmmakers the identity of a member of SEAL Team Six - though not a member of the team that conducted the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. Names of members of that team are not to be disclosed because of the potential for violent retaliation. \\n \\n Some in the Pentagon think the Inspector General is holding the report until after the current Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, retires so as to not sully or embarrass him. \\n \\n A senior defense official disputed that. \\\"It's wrong for anyone to suggest the investigation has been held up for political reasons or to avoid embarrassment,\\\" the official said. \\\"The investigation simply hasn't concluded. These things often take time.\\\" \\n \\n The official added that Pentagon officials \\\"really don't think this will amount to anything.\\\" \\n \\n Documents released in May, after the conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained them through the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that in a July 14, 2011 meeting, Vickers told the filmmakers he would provide them with the name of a \\\"planner, SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"The only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant because . . . he shouldn't be talking out of school.\\\" Vickers said. \\\"This at least, this gives him one step removed and he knows what he can and can't say, but this way at least he can be as open as he can with you and it ought to meet your needs.\\\" \\n \\n The senior defense official said that Vickers was asked by the Pentagon to talk to \\\"the 'Zero Dark Thirty' filmmakers and others in the entertainment industry to provide unclassified information on the bin Laden operation.

Vickers, the Pentagon's undersecretary for Intelligence, gave filmmakers the name of a member of SEAL Team Six who helped plan the raid\\u2014though not, ABC News reports, one of the SEALs who actually conducted the raid. But so far, the Justice Department has declined to prosecute. Vickers is Leon Panetta's top intelligence adviser, and it's not clear whether the matter will hurt his shot at the CIA directorship. One senior defense official says it's simply \\\"a routine practice\\\" to refer issues like this to the Justice Department, and adds that Pentagon officials doubt the case \\\"will amount to anything,\\\" particularly since a 2011 conversation in which Vickers talked to the filmmakers about the SEAL, mentioning him by name, was deemed unclassified by the Pentagon.

Peter King's request, but his office hadn't been notified of any findings by this week. King says that \\\"raises the question\\\" of whether the delay was for political reasons.

This was years before we'd set foot on the moon. Decades before we'd land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds. \\n \\n I still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge. \\n \\n That's one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever. \\n \\n In the years since, we've revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry. \\n \\n Last year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter's moons, and we mapped Pluto -- more than 3 billion miles away -- in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we're pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We've flown by every planet in the solar system -- something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers. \\n \\n This week, we'll convene some of America's leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives. \\n \\n Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \\n \\n We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station. \\n \\n The next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth's orbit. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth -- something we'll need for the long journey to Mars. \\n \\n The reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination \\\"with a force mightier than gravity.\\\" Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students -- the Mars generation -- walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn't happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education. \\n \\n President Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it's why I'm proud that we've passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we're on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade. \\n \\n When our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had \\\"in fact discovered the Earth.\\\" If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won't just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we'll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves. \\n \\n Someday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth. ||||| Story highlights Following a 2010 speech, President Barack Obama discussed Tuesday plans for humans to go to Mars \\n \\n Seven companies have received awards to develop habitation systems on Mars \\n \\n (CNN) President Barack Obama has his eyes on the stars -- or more accurately -- a planet. \\n \\n In an op-ed published Tuesday on CNN, Obama set a \\\"clear goal\\\" to send humans to Mars by the 2030s and to have them return to Earth safely, \\\"with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Someday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time,\\\" Obama wrote. \\\"But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.\\\" \\n \\n Achieving the goal, Obama added, will \\\"require continued cooperation between government and private innovators\\\" -- a collaboration that will begin in the coming years when companies send astronauts to the International Space Station. \\n \\n To that end, Obama announced that the government is \\\"working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space.\\\" \\n \\n Read More ||||| The following is crossposted from NASA.gov. \\n \\n Today, President Obama outlined a vision to CNN for the future of space exploration. Echoing what he said in the 2015 State of the Union address, the President wrote, \\u201cWe have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America\\u2019s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\\u201d Later this week, many of the Nation\\u2019s top innovators will come together in Pittsburgh at the White House Frontiers Conference, where they will further explore, among other things, how American investments in science and technology will help us settle \\u201cthe final frontier\\u201d \\u2013 space. But today, we\\u2019re excited to announce two new NASA initiatives that build on the President\\u2019s vision and utilize public-private partnerships to enable humans to live and work in space in a sustainable way. \\n \\n In April 2010, the President challenged the country \\u2013 and NASA \\u2013 to send American astronauts on a Journey to Mars in the 2030s. By reaching out further into the solar system and expanding the frontiers of exploration, the President outlined a vision for pushing the bounds of human discovery, while also revitalizing the space industry and creating jobs here at home. \\n \\n To achieve these mutually-reinforcing goals, the President instructed NASA to develop spacecraft and technologies geared toward sending astronauts to deep space, while at the same time partnering with American companies to build a strong space economy. Following the President\\u2019s vision, NASA has worked over the past 6 years to help catalyze a vibrant new sector of the economy by enabling the commercial transportation of cargo and soon crew from American soil to the International Space Station. And today, Americans are working at more than a thousand companies across virtually every state to support commercial space initiatives and with them, the growth of a new commercial market in Low Earth Orbit. \\n \\n On the International Space Station, we\\u2019re working \\u201coff-the-Earth, for-the-Earth,\\u201d leading a broad international coalition of countries and companies in conducting research and demonstrating technologies that hold great promise for everything ranging from sending human beings to Mars to improving eye surgery to purifying drinking water and making communities more resilient when natural disasters strike. \\n \\n This work aboard the space station is the heart and soul of the first stage of NASA\\u2019s Journey to Mars; a stage we call \\u201cEarth Dependent.\\u201d It is focused on developing technologies and capabilities in earth orbit, where it is still fairly easy for us to directly support humans. But over the next decade, we\\u2019ll enter the \\u201cProving Ground\\u201d stage, where NASA, leading the way with the international community, will demonstrate and test technologies for the first time in cis-lunar space, the area around the moon, where our astronauts are days or weeks away from Earth, rather than hours. For example, in the mid-2020s, NASA\\u2019s Asteroid Redirect Mission will send a robotic spacecraft to a nearby asteroid to test out important exploration technologies such as solar-electric propulsion, conduct scientific and planetary defense experiments, and then return a boulder from the asteroid to an orbit around the Moon for astronauts to study. As the title of this stage indicates, this work serves as necessary preparation for eventual missions that will take humanity even further, to Mars and beyond. \\n \\n And that brings us to the first thing we\\u2019re excited to discuss today. NASA has already begun laying the groundwork for these deep space missions. In 2014 we issued a \\u201cbroad agency announcement\\u201d or \\u201cBAA\\u201d asking private partners for concept studies and development projects in advanced propulsion, small satellites, and habitation as part of the newly created Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships or \\u201cNextSTEP\\u201d program. Six companies received awards to start developing habitation systems in response to that \\u201cNextSTEP\\u201d BAA. The idea is that these habitats or \\u201chabs\\u201d would evolve into spacecraft capable of sustaining and transporting astronauts on long duration deep space missions, like a mission to Mars. And their development would be achieved through new public-private partnerships designed to build on and support the progress of the growing commercial space sector in Earth orbit. The work done by those companies was so promising that earlier this year, we extended the NextSTEP hab program into Phase 2 and opened it up to new entrants. In August, six companies were selected to produce ground prototypes for deep space habitat modules. Learn more about the six selected prototypes. \\n \\n At the same time that we\\u2019re working to extend our reach into deep space, we\\u2019re also continuing to innovate closer to Earth, by expanding our partnerships with commercial space companies. And that\\u2019s the second initiative we are focused on today. Recently, NASA asked the private sector how it might use an available docking port on the ISS. One of the potential uses of such a port would be preparation for one or more future commercial stations in Low Earth Orbit, ready to take over for the Space Station once its mission ends in the 2020s. The private sector responded enthusiastically, and those responses indicated a strong desire by U.S. companies to attach a commercial module to the ISS that could meet the needs of NASA as well as those of private entrepreneurs. \\n \\n As a result of the responses, this fall, NASA will start the process of providing companies with a potential opportunity to add their own modules and other capabilities to the International Space Station. While NASA prepares for the transition from the Space Station to its successors, the agency is also working to support and grow the community of scientists and entrepreneurs conducting research and growing businesses in space. A vibrant user community will be key to ensuring the economic viability of future space stations. \\n \\n For humanity to successfully and sustainably settle the \\u201cfinal frontier\\u201d, we will need to take advantage of investment and innovation in both the public and private sectors. Neither will handle this immense challenge on its own. The NextSTEP and ISS initiatives are excellent examples of how the two sectors can work together to extend humanity\\u2019s reach into space. Make no mistake, the Journey to Mars will be challenging, but it is underway and with each one of these steps, we are pushing the boundaries of exploration and imagination for the Nation. \\n \\n Charles Bolden is the Administrator of NASA.\",\n          \"Fans wear shirts emblazoned with the misspelled surname of Colorado Rockies All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki that were given away to attendees as the Rockies hosted the Pittsburgh Pirates in a baseball...

They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. \\n \\n He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. \\n \\n It is only the second time a \\u201cThing\\u201d site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. \\n \\n David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. \\n \\n He said Thorfinn\\u2019s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth\\u2019s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. \\n \\n The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. \\n \\n But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council\\u2019s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. \\n \\n Mr MacDonald said: \\u201cYou can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a \\u2018Thing\\u2019. \\n \\n \\u201cIt has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.\\u201d \\n \\n In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park \\u2013 which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 \\u2013 as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town\\u2019s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. \\n \\n A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. \\n \\n According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O\\u2019Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : \\u201cThe excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. \\n \\n \\u201cThe radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. \\n \\n \\u201cThe lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. \\n \\n \\u201cThe substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.\\u201d \\n \\n Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man. ||||| A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests \\n \\n A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. \\n \\n The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a \\\"Thing\\\" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. \\n \\n \\\"It's a fantastic find, really,\\\" said Oliver J. T. O'Grady, the director of the site's excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. \\\"No one's had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland.\\\" \\n \\n The Thing \\n \\n Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means \\\"the field of the assembly.\\\" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] \\n \\n Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. \\n \\n \\\"Many archaeologists have said, 'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?'\\\" O'Grady told LiveScience. \\n \\n O'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. \\n \\n Digging up democracy \\n \\n Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. \\u2014 Richard III's skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) \\n \\n The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) \\n \\n The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel. \\n \\n A site in Dingwall, Scotland, revealed traces of a 13th century iron vessel underneath a parking lot. Credit: Dr. Oliver J. T. O'Grady \\n \\n But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. \\n \\n By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. \\n \\n No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. \\n \\n No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. \\n \\n \\\"He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,\\\" O'Grady said. \\n \\n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (\\\"BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program\\\") to the silly (\\\"BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks\\\") to\\u2014most important\\u2014the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: \\\"BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES.\\\" \\n \\n Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. \\\"You touch my junk,\\\" he said, \\\"and I'm going to have you arrested.\\\" \\n \\n What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped. \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state\\u2014of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove\\u2014was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can't be trusted. \\n \\n It's worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn't until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were \\\"not consistent with a free society.\\\" \\n \\n At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of \\\"a strong DHS,\\\" which quickly became a byword for \\\"being serious about terrorism,\\\" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful\\u2014and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful\\u2014campaign issue. \\n \\n There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn't have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card\\u2014technically, nationally compatible state IDs\\u2014that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. \\n \\n Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. \\n \\n \\\"I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?\\\" said Blank. \\\"When [Bush's second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber.\\\" \\n \\n The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential\\u2014it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn't really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. \\n \\n They have the media, too, for what that's worth. Alex Altman's take on the \\\"hysteria\\\" in Time dismissed the backlash as \\\"tailor-made for the Internet's ephemeral obsessions\\\" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. \\\"Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,\\\" said Altman, \\\"and this may be one of those cases.\\\" \\n \\n Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn't understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn't cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren't particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren't happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long. \\n \\n Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. \\n \\n Like Slate Politics on Facebook.

They are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing. And they are blocking a Senate vote on a treaty with Russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping Iran from gaining the bomb. \\n \\n For Democrats, the opposition's gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. Republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era, in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama. There's no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans' security. \\n \\n Let's start with START, the proposed nuclear pact with Russia that Senate Republicans such as Jon Kyl (Ariz.) are attempting to derail, at least until the next Congress. Since the expiration of the previous START treaty last December, there have been no U.S. inspectors in Russia to keep an eye on the country's thousands of nuclear warheads. If the Senate doesn't come up with the 67 votes needed for ratification, says Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security, there's a risk Russia will retaliate by removing its logistical support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan, abandoning its cooperation in preventing nuclear proliferation, and thwarting U.S. efforts to keep Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. \\n \\n But don't take his word for it. Listen to Richard Lugar, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and one man who still puts the national interest above political considerations. \\\"We're talking today about the national security of the United States of America,\\\" he pleaded on Wednesday. \\\"[T]his treaty must be ratified and be ratified in this session of the Congress.... We're talking about thousands of warheads that are still there, an existential problem for our country. To temporize at this point I think is inexcusable.\\\" \\n \\n Or listen to Bob Gates, the Bush/Obama defense secretary. \\\"The new START treaty has the unanimous support of America's military leadership,\\\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, calling for a strong bipartisan majority to support the treaty because of \\\"the security it provides to the American people.\\\" \\n \\n To borrow Bush's phrase, are Republicans not interested in the security of the American people? \\n \\n Then there's the backlash over the new imaging and pat-downs being used to screen airport passengers for explosives. A CBS News poll found that 81 percent of Americans favor use of the new imaging machines, but Republican lawmakers feel otherwise. \\n \\n In the House, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) has already introduced legislation rescinding the new security. Meanwhile, Republican senators, rediscovering their inner civil libertarians, this week took turns criticizing Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole over the administration's tightened security. \\n \\n \\\"I wouldn't want my wife to be touched in the way that these folks are being touched. I wouldn't want to be touched that way,\\\" said Sen. George LeMieux (Fla.). \\\"I think weve gone too far.\\\" \\n \\n Sen. Mike Johanns (Neb.) warned of a \\\"tipping point\\\" against security screening. \\\"Does that worry you, that maybe we're at a point here where... people just thing you've overstepped?\\\" \\n \\n Pistole reminded Johanns that \\\"the threats are real.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"I'm thinking nothing's going to change,\\\" Johanns complained. \\n \\n Pistole's response should shame Johanns and his colleagues. \\\"If your question is, do I understand the sensitivities of people? Yes. If you're asking, am I going to change the policies? No, because I think that it is being informed by the latest intelligence, the latest efforts by terrorists to kill our people in the air. No, I'm not going to change those policies.\\\" \\n \\n This may be the post-post-9/11 era, but Pistole, a career FBI guy, is still interested in the security of the American people. Are Republicans? \\n \\n danamilbank@washpost.com \\n \\n Dana Milbank was online to chat with Post readers at 11:30 a.m. Friday, Nov. 19.

He has had his picture in the paper standing next to Celine Dion. He's the generous neighbour who shares a freshly caught trout and drives passengers around in his military vehicle decorated with Mickey Mouse decals. \\n \\n The locals are now shocked by news that has made international headlines. \\n \\n Police sources confirmed they arrested a suspect by that name in the Montreal shooting that left one person dead and made headlines around the world. \\n \\n The suspect in Tuesday's attack was wearing a housecoat and black facemask when he was tackled by police. He shouted about an awakening of English-speaking Quebecers as he was whisked away. \\n \\n A hospital statement said Wednesday a man in police custody was undergoing an evaluation. Police said there could be charges laid in the case Thursday. \\n \\n A Facebook page says a Richard Henry Bain runs a riverside lodge near Mont-Tremblant, Que. A website for the business was taken down Wednesday. \\n \\n Bain, 62, was in constant contact with officials at the local municipality, La Conception, over the past several months as he tried to expand his business, according to the village manager. \\n \\n He had applied to add licences for hunting and ice fishing at the lodge, Marie-France Brisson said in an interview. \\n \\n The village received a copy of a letter addressed to Bain from a biologist conducting an environmental assessment. \\n \\n It said the ice-fishing licence needed further study before being approved. \\n \\n The village received its copy Tuesday -- hours before the shooting. Brisson said Bain may have received the letter the same day. \\n \\n \\\"He was a man that was calm and polite who could also be frank,\\\" Brisson said. \\n \\n \\\"He could sometimes be frustrated (with the bureaucratic process).\\\" \\n \\n There is no evidence of any link between the man's business interests and the shooting. \\n \\n Neighbours who live across the highway from the entrance to Bain's property couldn't believe the friendly, generous man they know as \\\"Rick\\\" or \\\"Scottish\\\" could be linked to such an incident. \\n \\n Bain, who was occasionally seen wearing a kilt, would sometimes down beers with locals in the rural mountainous area close to the popular Mont-Tremblant park. \\n \\n He wasn't all business, all the time. \\n \\n A photo in a local newspaper from earlier this year shows Bain, dressed in a dapper black suit and white-collared shirt, standing alongside Celine Dion in Las Vegas. \\n \\n The newspaper, Info du Nord Tremblant, said Bain and another man, David Bain, won VIP tickets at a local fundraising auction to see the singer last January. \\n \\n Several people in the area said Bain started inviting anglers to fish for trout two years ago on the sweeping property in a dense forest. \\n \\n His clients would park their vehicles on a grassy piece of land alongside the highway. Bain would drive them several kilometres up a bumpy trail into the backwoods aboard his three-axle military truck. \\n \\n Bain's imposing army truck sat on the edge of the highway Wednesday, a couple of hundred metres from a locked gate leading to the property, which is on Crown land. \\n \\n The olive-coloured truck catches the attention of passersby. It has Mickey Mouse decals on both doors to the cab. The image of Mickey features moose antlers instead of his trademark round mouse ears. \\n \\n Neighbour Real Papineau said Bain was focused on attracting more business and asked him in the spring to hand out some pamphlets publicizing the fishing camp. \\n \\n To return the favour, Papineau said Bain brought him a large brook trout as a thank you. \\n \\n \\\"Incredible,\\\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief when a reporter told him that Bain's name was linked to the killing. \\n \\n \\\"He was always in a good mood. I never heard him make any negative remarks.\\\" \\n \\n Marc-Andre Cyr, the owner of a campground near Bain's lodge, also said he was friendly and never showed any anger toward French-speaking Quebecers. \\n \\n Cyr said they occasionally had a beer together. They always spoke French. \\n \\n \\\"He's someone I would meet from time to time,\\\" he said. \\\"We never talked politics.\\\" \\n \\n He said he met Bain just over a year ago and that the man was new to the region. Bain joined the local chamber of commerce about a year ago. Police sources say he had relocated from Montreal. \\n \\n Another man, Dominic Bouffard, who works for the local paper, said Bain is a successful businessman who occasionally took out ads to promote his lodge. Bouffard said he tried hard to network with local politicians and business leaders. \\n \\n \\\"He did everything he could to meet people in the municipality, in the (Mont-Tremblant area), and everywhere,\\\" Bouffard said. \\n \\n --with files from Benjamin Shingler and Julien Arsenault. ||||| A historic Quebec election that returned the Parti Qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9cois to power ended in tragedy Tuesday when a gunman killed one person and wounded another, then tried to start a fire at the Montreal venue where PQ Leader Pauline Marois was celebrating her minority mandate. \\n \\n Police said a suspect entered a vestibule at the back of the Metropolis nightclub and fired shots, wounding two people critically. The suspect then started a fire and ran away on foot. \\n \\n One shooting victim, a 45-year-old man, died at the scene. At a 6 a.m. press conference Wednesday, Montreal police said the second shooting victim, 27, was no longer in danger. Ambulance services reported another person is in hospital suffering from shock. \\n \\n Montreal police spokesmen said they have arrested a 62-year-old man from Quebec, but not Montreal, who spoke French with an accent. The suspect has not been identified. Police have opened a homicide investigation and have seized two firearms. Suret\\u00e9 du Qu\\u00e9bec spokesman Guy Lapointe says police cannot rule out that Ms. Marois was the intended target. \\n \\n \\u201cThe English are waking up, the English are waking up ... It's payback ... Yeah, yeah, that\\u2019s enough,\\u201d the man said as police officers led him away in handcuffs. The suspect, a heavyset, bespectacled man, wore a balaclava, shorts and what appeared to be a bathrobe. \\n \\n [Editor's note: Comments were originally open on this story. However we have now closed comments for legal reasons following the arrest of a man after people were shot and a fire was set outside the PQ victory celebration. Readers can still access comments posted earlier by clicking here.] \\n \\n Ms. Marois was in the middle of her victory speech, after narrowly defeating Jean Charest\\u2019s Liberals by a handful of seats and about one percentage point in the popular vote, when several plainclothes police officers from her security detail suddenly burst on stage and pulled her away, shouting \\\"Go with us, madam!\\\" She later returned and spoke to the crowd. \\n \\n Earlier, Ms. Marois had acknowledged the ambivalence of Quebec voters in giving her a narrow minority mandate. \\n \\n \\\"We will respect that choice by governing with all the other elected lawmakers. We'll make the necessary compromises to make the state work ... We'll govern in a responsible way.\\\" \\n \\n Ms. Marois, who had been severely criticized for campaigning on identity and language themes, had some conciliatory words for Quebec's anglophone and native communities, speaking of their shared history and, in a rare move for her, speaking in English to say their rights would be respected. \\n \\n However, she struck a tougher stance towards the rest of Canada. \\n \\n \\\"As a nation, we want to take ourselves the decisions that affect us. We want a country. And we'll have it.\\\" \\n \\n Liberal Leader Jean Charest, the outgoing premier, lost in his riding, for the first time in a 28-year career that began when he was elected to Parliament on this day in 1984. \\n \\n \\\"The results of this election speaks to the fact the future of Quebec lies within Canada,\\\" he said. He also quipped that, \\\"I want to thank the activists of the Liberal party who once again proved the polls wrong.\\\" \\n \\n In his concession speech, Mr. Charest boasted that his party \\\"will leave the house in good order.\\\" \\n \\n Mr. Charest predicted that the Liberals would bounce back. Pointing an index up, he noted that there was \\\"one percentage point in the popular vote between us (and the PQ).\\\" \\n \\n He made no comments about his political future. A press conference is scheduled for Wednesday. \\n \\n In a statement issued early Wednesday by Prime Minister Stephen Harper\\u2019s office, he said: \\u201cWe are disturbed by this violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.\\u201d \\n \\n Earlier, Mr. Harper congratulated Ms. Marois \\u2014 then delivered a pointed barb aimed at the independence project. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t believe Quebeckers want to reopen the old constitutional quarrels of the past,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\n \\n \\u201cOur government will remain focused on jobs, economic growth and good economic management. We believe economic issues and jobs are also the priority of Quebeckers. In that sense, we will continue working with the Government of Quebec on those common objectives.\\u201d \\n \\n Report Typo/Error\",\n          \"Remains of major new prehistoric stone monument at Durrington Walls discovered The remains of a major new prehistoric stone monument have been discovered less than 3 kilometres from Stonehenge. Using cutting edge, multi-sensor technologies the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project has revealed evidence for a large stone monument hidden beneath the bank of the later Durrington Walls 'super-henge'. \\n \\n Read more on this latest discovery... \\n \\n The \\\"Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project\\\" \\n \\n Stonehenge occupies one of the richest archaeological landscapes in the world, recorded in the course of intensive archaeological and antiquarian research over several hundred years, yet much of this landscape effectively remains terra incognita. This project aims to address gaps in our knowledge and to advance the understanding of the Stonehenge landscape by conducting a cutting-edge geophysical and remote sensing survey at unprecedented scale. \\n \\n The results of the proposed work will be used to create a highly detailed archaeological map of the 'invisible' landscape, providing the basis for a full interpretative synthesis of all existing remote sensing and geophysical data from the study area, For the first it will thus be possible to create total digital models of the Stonehenge landscape at a true 'landscape scale' that will not only transcend the immediate surrounds of individual monuments within the study area, but will also tie them together within a seamless map of sub-surface and surface archaeological features and structures. \\n \\n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, led by the University of Birmingham in conjunction with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, is the largest project of its kind. \\n \\n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is a collaboration between the University of Birmingham, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna and its international partners, the University of Bradford, the University of St Andrews, and the 'ORBit' Research Group of the Department of Soil Management at the University of Ghent, Belgium. \\n \\n The project operates under the auspices of the National Trust and English Heritage. ||||| We walked the Avenue, the ancient route along which the stones were first dragged from the River Avon. For centuries, this was the formal path to the great henge, but now the only hint of its existence was an indentation or two in the tall grass. It was a fine English summer\\u2019s day, with thin, fast clouds above, and as we passed through fields dotted with buttercups and daisies, cows and sheep, we could have been hikers anywhere, were it not for the ghostly monument in the near distance. \\n \\n Faint as the Avenue was, Vince Gaffney hustled along as if it were illuminated by runway lights. A short, sprightly archaeologist of 56, from Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England, he knows this landscape as well as anyone alive: has walked it, breathed it, studied it for uncounted hours. He has not lost his sense of wonder. Stopping to fix the monument in his eyeline, and reaching out toward the stones on the horizon, he said, \\u201cLook, it becomes cathedralesque.\\u201d \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s latest research effort, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, is a four-year collaboration between a British team and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Austria that has produced the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding Stonehenge, totaling more than four square miles. The results are astonishing. The researchers have found buried evidence of more than 15 previously unknown or poorly understood late Neolithic monuments: henges, barrows, segmented ditches, pits. To Gaffney, these findings suggest a scale of activity around Stonehenge far beyond what was previously suspected. \\u201cThere was sort of this idea that Stonehenge sat in the middle and around it was effectively an area where people were probably excluded,\\u201d Gaffney told me, \\u201ca ring of the dead around a special area\\u2014to which few people might ever have been admitted....Perhaps there were priests, big men, whatever they were, inside Stonehenge having processions up the Avenue, doing...something extremely mysterious. Of course that sort of analysis depends on not knowing what\\u2019s actually in the area around Stonehenge itself. It was terra incognita, really.\\u201d \\n \\n Nobody has yet put a spade in the ground to verify the new findings, which were painstakingly gathered by geophysicists and others wielding magnetometers and ground-penetrating radars that scan the ground to detect structures and objects several yards below the surface. But Gaffney has no doubt of the work\\u2019s value. \\u201cThis is among the most important landscapes, and probably the most studied landscape, in the world,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey. Won\\u2019t be the same again.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n The joys and frustrations of all archaeological study\\u2014perhaps all historical inquiry\\u2014come into particularly sharp relief at Stonehenge. Even to the most casual observer, the monument is deeply significant. Those vast stones, standing in concentric rings in the middle of a basin on Salisbury Plain, carefully placed by who-knows-who thousands of years ago, must mean something. But nobody can tell us what. Not exactly. The clues that remain will always prove insufficient to our curiosity. Each archaeological advance yields more questions, and more theories to be tested. Our ignorance shrinks by fractions. What we know is always dwarfed by what we can never know. \\n \\n Take the big question: Was Stonehenge predominantly a temple, a parliament or a graveyard? Was it a healing ground? We don\\u2019t know, for sure. We know that people were buried there, and that the stones are aligned in astronomically important ways. We also understand, because of the chemical composition of animal bones found nearby and the provenance of the stones, that people traveled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge. But we cannot say, with certainty, why. \\n \\n Try a simpler question: How did the bluestones, which weigh between four and eight tons apiece, arrive at the site, nearly 5,000 years ago, from 170 miles away in West Wales? Land or sea? Both alternatives explode with possibilities, and nobody has an impregnable theory. Mike Parker Pearson of University College London is working on a new idea that the bluestones might have been lifted onto huge wooden lattices and carried by dozens of men to the site. But it\\u2019s just a theory. We can\\u2019t know, definitively. We can only have better-informed questions. \\n \\n The ineffability of Stonehenge has not dulled our appetite. The site has long proved irresistible to diggers. In 1620, the Duke of Buckingham had his men excavate right in the center of the monument. Although they did not know it at the time, they dug on the site of a prehistoric pit. Buckingham\\u2019s men found skulls of cattle \\u201cand other beasts\\u201d and large quantities of \\u201cburnt coals or charcoals\\u201d\\u2014but no treasure, as they had hoped. \\n \\n In the 19th century, \\u201cbarrow-digging,\\u201d or the excavation of prehistoric monuments and burial hills, was a popular pastime among the landed gentry. In 1839, a naval officer named Captain Beamish dug out an estimated 400 cubic feet of soil from the northeast of the Altar Stone at Stonehenge. As Parker Pearson notes in his book Stonehenge, Beamish\\u2019s \\u201cbig hole was probably the final blow for any prehistoric features...that once lay at Stonehenge\\u2019s center.\\u201d \\n \\n Work at Stonehenge became less invasive. In 1952, Willard Libby\\u2014the American chemist and later a Nobel Prize winner\\u2014used his new radiocarbon dating technique on a piece of charcoal from a pit within Stonehenge to date the monument to 1848 B.C., give or take 275 years. That date has since been refined several times. The prevailing opinion is that the first stones were erected on the site around 2600 B.C. (although the building of Stonehenge was carried out over a millennium, and there were centuries of ritual activity at the site before the stones were in place). \\n \\n In 2003, Parker Pearson conducted his own survey, concentrating on the nearby settlement at Durrington Walls and the area between there and the River Avon. Based on huts, tools and animal bones he uncovered, he concluded that Durrington Walls likely housed the workers who built Stonehenge. Based on an analysis of human remains he later excavated from Stonehenge, he also surmised that, far from being a site of quotidian religious activity, Stonehenge served as a cemetery\\u2013a \\u201cplace for the dead.\\u201d \\n \\n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is different from everything that came before it. When Gaffney and his team started their work, they were less interested in theories than in data. To that end, they concentrated on taking what amounts to a three-dimensional and yards-deep photograph of the entire landscape. \\u201cThe perceived wisdom was driven by the monuments we knew about,\\u201d says Gaffney. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve put in the data between the monuments.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n Chris Gaffney, Vince\\u2019s younger, slighter and less voluble brother, was one of the instigators of this new approach. The duo\\u2019s grandfather was a metalwork teacher from Newcastle with an interest in archaeology, who took his clever grandchildren on trips to Hadrian\\u2019s Wall, the old barrier between the Roman Empire and the blasted north. Small wonder that Vince became an archaeologist and Chris a geophysicist, now at the University of Bradford. \\n \\n The Gaffney brothers\\u2019 interest in new technologies that were becoming available to archaeologists led them to the first GPS-guided magnetometer systems. A magnetometer has sensors that allow a geophysicist to see evidence of historic building, and even ancient ditch-digging, beneath the soil by mapping variations in the earth\\u2019s magnetic field. The GPS-guided versions were able to pinpoint some of those discoveries to within one centimeter. The Gaffneys believed that Stonehenge scholarship needed a massive magnetometer- and radar-led survey of the whole site. \\u201cWe just didn\\u2019t know if anything\\u2019s there,\\u201d Vince Gaffney recalled. \\u201cSo we\\u2019re constructing various hypotheses on the basis of something we don\\u2019t know.\\u201d \\n \\n Around the same time, an Austrian archaeologist named Wolfgang Neubauer, now of the Boltzmann Institute, was hoping to conduct large-scale projects all over Europe using tools including GPS magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar. Neubauer\\u2019s team had also developed software to process the 40 or 50 gigabytes of raw data that these instruments could create in a day. Suddenly, instead of waiting weeks or months to see what the machines had found, it was possible to cover several acres with magnetometers and radar in a day and to display that information on a screen almost instantaneously. \\n \\n One of the areas Neubauer wanted to scan was Stonehenge, and in the spring of 2009 he contacted Vince Gaffney. A few months later, the Boltzmann Institute and the University of Birmingham\\u2014plus several other British and European universities, museums and companies that contributed expertise and resources\\u2014began their collaboration at Stonehenge. \\n \\n Their first days on site, Gaffney recalled, were \\u201clike a geophysical circus has come to town.\\u201d Tractors pushed the ground-penetrating radars, which looked like high-powered lawn mowers. All-terrain vehicles dragged the magnetometer sensors on long strings. Delicate instruments covering hard, uneven ground kept mechanics and technicians busy. \\u201cI have seen one of our magnetometers shear clear apart in front of me,\\u201d said Gaffney. \\u201cIt was back in service the next day.\\u201d In all, the fieldwork took about 120 days, spread over four years. \\n \\n *** \\n \\n In a multimedia room at the University of Birmingham there was a vast touch screen, six feet by nine, on which a new map of the Stonehenge landscape appeared. Gaffney pointed out the key features. \\n \\n There was Stonehenge itself, marked by the familiar circles. To the north was the long, thin strip called the Stonehenge Cursus or the Greater Cursus, which was demarcated by ditches, and ran east to west for nearly two miles. (The Cursus was given its name by the antiquarian William Stukeley in the 18th century because it looked like an ancient Roman race course. Its construction predates the first building work at Stonehenge by several hundred years.) Gaffney also pointed out the Cursus Barrows\\u2014hillocks containing mass human graves\\u2014just south of the Cursus itself, and King Barrow Ridge to the east. \\n \\n Scattered all over the map were blotches of black: features without names. These were new finds, including the more than 15 possible new or poorly understood Neolithic monuments. Gaffney emphasized possible, acknowledging that it will require digging\\u2014\\u201cthe testimony of the spade\\u201d\\u2014to discover precisely what was there. \\n \\n Standing in front of this constellation of evidence, he seemed unable to decide where to start, like a child at the Christmas tree. \\u201cThese are little henge monuments,\\u201d he said, touching the screen to highlight a group of black smudges. \\u201cNice little entrance there, and a ditch. These things we know nothing about.\\u201d \\n \\n He saved his greatest enthusiasm for the discoveries that had been made in the Cursus. This feature, said Gaffney, had always been thought of as a \\u201cbloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge.\\u201d Nobody knew quite what it was for. Because the Cursus runs east to west, archaeologists have always believed that its presence owes something to the passage of the sun. The monument must be significant: It was dug in the fourth millennium B.C. using antler picks\\u2014hundreds of thousands of man-hours went into its construction. \\n \\n The Hidden Landscapes Project\\u2019s instruments discovered several new clues. First of all, they found gaps in the ditch, in particular a very large break in the northern side, to allow people to enter and exit the Cursus. Now, instead of seeing the Cursus exclusively as a monument that encouraged movement along the path of the sun, east to west, Gaffney began to consider these gaps as \\u201cchannels through the landscape\\u201d to guide the movement of people north to south. \\n \\n A bigger discovery, Gaffney says, was a \\u201cbloody huge\\u201d pit about five yards in diameter at the eastern end of the Cursus. Today it lies buried at least three feet below the surface of the ground. Such a pit was much too large for a practical use\\u2014for instance, burying trash\\u2014because of the labor involved in digging it. In the archaeologists\\u2019 minds it could only have ritual implications, as \\u201ca marker of some kind,\\u201d Gaffney said. What\\u2019s more, if you drew a straight line between the pit and the heelstone at Stonehenge, it ran directly along the final section of the Avenue, on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice. \\n \\n \\u201cWe thought, That\\u2019s a bit of a coincidence!\\u201d Gaffney recalled. \\u201cThat was the point at which we thought, What\\u2019s at the other end? And there\\u2019s another pit! Two pits, marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice, set within a monument that\\u2019s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun.\\u201d \\n \\n With his hands passing over the map, Gaffney showed how\\u2014on the longest days of the year\\u2014the pits formed a triangle with Stonehenge marking sunrise and sunset. \\n \\n \\u201cNobody had ever seen these pits before,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut they link the area of Stonehenge with the Cursus directly. Either these things have been put inside the Cursus to mark these points, or the Cursus has been wrapped around them.\\u201d \\n \\n What was so interesting about the Cursus pits was that they told a story about the landscape. The \\u201csunrise\\u201d pit was visible from Stonehenge, but the \\u201csunset\\u201d pit was not\\u2014it was nestled behind a ridge, and could have been seen only if there had been fire and smoke coming from it. (At some point the pits will have to be excavated for evidence of such activity.) These discoveries fed into a larger understanding of Stonehenge as \\u201cdiachronic\\u201d\\u2014operating in light and dark, sunrise and sunset, day and night. \\n \\n \\u201cThe point I think we\\u2019re coming to,\\u201d said Gaffney, \\u201cis that increasingly we can see the area around Stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement\\u2014which we can now understand, largely because we know where things are.\\u201d \\n \\n Parker Pearson, for his part, takes a cautious view of the new research. \\u201cUntil you dig holes, you just don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019ve got,\\u201d he told me in his office at University College London. \\u201cWhat date it is, how significant it is. [There are] extraordinary new features coming up, and we\\u2019re thinking well, what are they?\\u201d \\n \\n To be sure, he said the data from the Hidden Landscapes Project \\u201cbacks up the pattern we\\u2019ve already been seeing for some years. We have an excessive number of solstice-aligned monuments in that landscape. Nowhere in the rest of Europe comes even close.\\u201d He added, \\u201cThis is fantastic stuff that\\u2019s been done, and it\\u2019s raised a whole series of new questions,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to take years.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n The clouds shifted in front of the sun, dappling the landscape with shadow. Gaffney and I were walking the Avenue, 300 yards or so from Stonehenge, and in the distance a string of barrows gleamed like opals. Although he acknowledged the fallibility of all archaeological projection (\\u201cIn the end,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwe are all wrong\\u201d), his work has led him to a new interpretation of how Stonehenge was used. \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s idea was not to focus on Stonehenge itself, but on \\u201cprocessionality\\u201d within the whole landscape. He imagined people moving around the area like Roman Catholics processing through the Stations of the Cross. He recalled an Easter Friday ritual he saw in Croatia, in which a \\u201cbloke with a cross\\u201d led fellow barefoot celebrants on a miles-long trip. In Gaffney\\u2019s view, the building of the great stone circle was a \\u201cmonumentalizing\\u201d of a similar, if heathen, procession. \\n \\n As we walked downhill through the fields, Gaffney stopped from time to time to point out the hillocks in which \\u201cthe illustrious dead\\u201d were buried. He also noted how the Avenue was not a straight line between the Avon and Stonehenge, but rather a series of tacks that brought the visitor to the Stonehenge site in a \\u201ctheatrical\\u201d way, along the line of sunrise on the summer solstice. \\n \\n He thrust himself into the mind of a Bronze Age visitor to the site. \\u201cYou will have seen nothing like it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt would have been massively impressive.\\u201d Soon we descended into a valley called Stonehenge Bottom, only a hundred yards or so from the great stones. \\u201cThey\\u2019re disappearing....Watch, just watch!\\u201d he said. \\n \\n Within a few yards, the monument became invisible. When you picture Stonehenge in your mind\\u2019s eye, you imagine the concentric rings of vast stones standing in a desolate open landscape, visible for miles around. But now, here we were, a hundred yards away, and the thing had gone. \\n \\n We stood in a field, watched by some lethargic cows, and savored the strangeness of the moment. Then, as we stepped uphill, Stonehenge re-emerged on the horizon. It happened fast. The lintels, then the great sarsens, then the smaller bluestones were suddenly before us. \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s voice lifted. He spoke about Jerusalem Syndrome: the feeling of intense emotion experienced by pilgrims on their first sighting of the Holy City. In the prehistoric world, there was no conception of God as he was understood by the later Abrahamic faiths. But, said Gaffney, as Stonehenge reappeared before us, \\u201cwhatever the ancient version of Jerusalem Syndrome is, that\\u2019s what you\\u2019re feeling now.\\u201d ||||| The mysteries of Stonehenge are revealed sometimes by unusual methods\\u2014forgetting to water its grass or whacking its stones with quartz.

Credit: Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n Among the hundreds of features that were mapped are 17 newly discovered Neolithic monuments, all dating to the same period as Stonehenge about 5,000 years ago. These pits and ditches, marked by post holes, often seem to be astronomically important. \\n \\n There is the Cursus, for instance, a rectangular space which is under two miles long and 300 feet wide. Two pits inside the Cursus appears to be aligned with the rising and setting sun on the summer solstice when seen from the Stonehenge's heel stone. Taken together, the monuments suggest Stonehenge is the most obvious remainder of a large complex of structures with ritual importance. \\n \\n The survey also revealed surprising facts about known structures, like the Durrington Walls, a dirt bank that encircles a circumference of a mile. Underneath one section of the dirt, archeologists found more than 50 huge stones, each 10 feet long, forming a \\\"super henge.\\\" \\\"That's a big prehistoric monument which we never knew anything about,\\\" the co-director of the investigation, Professor Vince Gaffney, told Nature.

[Financial Times, The Independent, Nature] \\n \\n Top image: donsimon/shutterstock ||||| Ludwig Boltzmann Institute \\n \\n Every summer solstice, tens of thousands of people throng to Stonehenge, creating a festival-like atmosphere at the 4,400-year-old stone monument. For the 2015 solstice, they will have a bit more room to spread out. A just-completed four-year project to map the vicinity of Stonehenge reveals a sprawling complex that includes 17 newly discovered monuments and signs of a 1.5-kilometre-around \\u2018super henge\\u2019. \\n \\n The digital map \\u2014 made from high-resolution radar and magnetic and laser scans that accumulated several terabytes of data \\u2014 shatters the picture of Stonehenge as a desolate and exclusive site that was visited by few, says Vincent Gaffney, an archaeologist at the University of Birmingham, UK, who co-led the effort. \\n \\n Take the cursus, a 3-kilometre-long, 100-metre-wide ditch north of Stonehenge that was thought to act as barrier. The team\\u2019s mapping uncovered gaps in the cursus leading to Stonehenge, as well as several large pits, one of which would have been perfectly aligned with the setting solstice Sun. New magnetic and radar surveys of the Durrington Walls (which had been excavated before) uncovered more than 60 now-buried holes in which stones would have sat, and a few stones still buried. \\n \\n \\u201cThey look as they may have been pushed over.

Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (\\\"BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program\\\") to the silly (\\\"BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks\\\") to\\u2014most important\\u2014the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: \\\"BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES.\\\" \\n \\n Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. \\\"You touch my junk,\\\" he said, \\\"and I'm going to have you arrested.\\\" \\n \\n What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped. \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state\\u2014of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove\\u2014was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can't be trusted. \\n \\n It's worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn't until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were \\\"not consistent with a free society.\\\" \\n \\n At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of \\\"a strong DHS,\\\" which quickly became a byword for \\\"being serious about terrorism,\\\" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful\\u2014and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful\\u2014campaign issue. \\n \\n There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn't have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card\\u2014technically, nationally compatible state IDs\\u2014that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. \\n \\n Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. \\n \\n \\\"I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?\\\" said Blank. \\\"When [Bush's second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber.\\\" \\n \\n The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential\\u2014it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn't really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. \\n \\n They have the media, too, for what that's worth. Alex Altman's take on the \\\"hysteria\\\" in Time dismissed the backlash as \\\"tailor-made for the Internet's ephemeral obsessions\\\" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. \\\"Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,\\\" said Altman, \\\"and this may be one of those cases.\\\" \\n \\n Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn't understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn't cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren't particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren't happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long. \\n \\n Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. \\n \\n Like Slate Politics on Facebook.

They are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing. And they are blocking a Senate vote on a treaty with Russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping Iran from gaining the bomb. \\n \\n For Democrats, the opposition's gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. Republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era, in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama. There's no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans' security. \\n \\n Let's start with START, the proposed nuclear pact with Russia that Senate Republicans such as Jon Kyl (Ariz.) are attempting to derail, at least until the next Congress. Since the expiration of the previous START treaty last December, there have been no U.S. inspectors in Russia to keep an eye on the country's thousands of nuclear warheads. If the Senate doesn't come up with the 67 votes needed for ratification, says Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security, there's a risk Russia will retaliate by removing its logistical support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan, abandoning its cooperation in preventing nuclear proliferation, and thwarting U.S. efforts to keep Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. \\n \\n But don't take his word for it. Listen to Richard Lugar, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and one man who still puts the national interest above political considerations. \\\"We're talking today about the national security of the United States of America,\\\" he pleaded on Wednesday. \\\"[T]his treaty must be ratified and be ratified in this session of the Congress.... We're talking about thousands of warheads that are still there, an existential problem for our country. To temporize at this point I think is inexcusable.\\\" \\n \\n Or listen to Bob Gates, the Bush/Obama defense secretary. \\\"The new START treaty has the unanimous support of America's military leadership,\\\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, calling for a strong bipartisan majority to support the treaty because of \\\"the security it provides to the American people.\\\" \\n \\n To borrow Bush's phrase, are Republicans not interested in the security of the American people? \\n \\n Then there's the backlash over the new imaging and pat-downs being used to screen airport passengers for explosives. A CBS News poll found that 81 percent of Americans favor use of the new imaging machines, but Republican lawmakers feel otherwise. \\n \\n In the House, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) has already introduced legislation rescinding the new security. Meanwhile, Republican senators, rediscovering their inner civil libertarians, this week took turns criticizing Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole over the administration's tightened security. \\n \\n \\\"I wouldn't want my wife to be touched in the way that these folks are being touched. I wouldn't want to be touched that way,\\\" said Sen. George LeMieux (Fla.). \\\"I think weve gone too far.\\\" \\n \\n Sen. Mike Johanns (Neb.) warned of a \\\"tipping point\\\" against security screening. \\\"Does that worry you, that maybe we're at a point here where... people just thing you've overstepped?\\\" \\n \\n Pistole reminded Johanns that \\\"the threats are real.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"I'm thinking nothing's going to change,\\\" Johanns complained. \\n \\n Pistole's response should shame Johanns and his colleagues. \\\"If your question is, do I understand the sensitivities of people? Yes. If you're asking, am I going to change the policies? No, because I think that it is being informed by the latest intelligence, the latest efforts by terrorists to kill our people in the air. No, I'm not going to change those policies.\\\" \\n \\n This may be the post-post-9/11 era, but Pistole, a career FBI guy, is still interested in the security of the American people. Are Republicans? \\n \\n danamilbank@washpost.com \\n \\n Dana Milbank was online to chat with Post readers at 11:30 a.m. Friday, Nov. 19.

He has had his picture in the paper standing next to Celine Dion. He's the generous neighbour who shares a freshly caught trout and drives passengers around in his military vehicle decorated with Mickey Mouse decals. \\n \\n The locals are now shocked by news that has made international headlines. \\n \\n Police sources confirmed they arrested a suspect by that name in the Montreal shooting that left one person dead and made headlines around the world. \\n \\n The suspect in Tuesday's attack was wearing a housecoat and black facemask when he was tackled by police. He shouted about an awakening of English-speaking Quebecers as he was whisked away. \\n \\n A hospital statement said Wednesday a man in police custody was undergoing an evaluation. Police said there could be charges laid in the case Thursday. \\n \\n A Facebook page says a Richard Henry Bain runs a riverside lodge near Mont-Tremblant, Que. A website for the business was taken down Wednesday. \\n \\n Bain, 62, was in constant contact with officials at the local municipality, La Conception, over the past several months as he tried to expand his business, according to the village manager. \\n \\n He had applied to add licences for hunting and ice fishing at the lodge, Marie-France Brisson said in an interview. \\n \\n The village received a copy of a letter addressed to Bain from a biologist conducting an environmental assessment. \\n \\n It said the ice-fishing licence needed further study before being approved. \\n \\n The village received its copy Tuesday -- hours before the shooting. Brisson said Bain may have received the letter the same day. \\n \\n \\\"He was a man that was calm and polite who could also be frank,\\\" Brisson said. \\n \\n \\\"He could sometimes be frustrated (with the bureaucratic process).\\\" \\n \\n There is no evidence of any link between the man's business interests and the shooting. \\n \\n Neighbours who live across the highway from the entrance to Bain's property couldn't believe the friendly, generous man they know as \\\"Rick\\\" or \\\"Scottish\\\" could be linked to such an incident. \\n \\n Bain, who was occasionally seen wearing a kilt, would sometimes down beers with locals in the rural mountainous area close to the popular Mont-Tremblant park. \\n \\n He wasn't all business, all the time. \\n \\n A photo in a local newspaper from earlier this year shows Bain, dressed in a dapper black suit and white-collared shirt, standing alongside Celine Dion in Las Vegas. \\n \\n The newspaper, Info du Nord Tremblant, said Bain and another man, David Bain, won VIP tickets at a local fundraising auction to see the singer last January. \\n \\n Several people in the area said Bain started inviting anglers to fish for trout two years ago on the sweeping property in a dense forest. \\n \\n His clients would park their vehicles on a grassy piece of land alongside the highway. Bain would drive them several kilometres up a bumpy trail into the backwoods aboard his three-axle military truck. \\n \\n Bain's imposing army truck sat on the edge of the highway Wednesday, a couple of hundred metres from a locked gate leading to the property, which is on Crown land. \\n \\n The olive-coloured truck catches the attention of passersby. It has Mickey Mouse decals on both doors to the cab. The image of Mickey features moose antlers instead of his trademark round mouse ears. \\n \\n Neighbour Real Papineau said Bain was focused on attracting more business and asked him in the spring to hand out some pamphlets publicizing the fishing camp. \\n \\n To return the favour, Papineau said Bain brought him a large brook trout as a thank you. \\n \\n \\\"Incredible,\\\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief when a reporter told him that Bain's name was linked to the killing. \\n \\n \\\"He was always in a good mood. I never heard him make any negative remarks.\\\" \\n \\n Marc-Andre Cyr, the owner of a campground near Bain's lodge, also said he was friendly and never showed any anger toward French-speaking Quebecers. \\n \\n Cyr said they occasionally had a beer together. They always spoke French. \\n \\n \\\"He's someone I would meet from time to time,\\\" he said. \\\"We never talked politics.\\\" \\n \\n He said he met Bain just over a year ago and that the man was new to the region. Bain joined the local chamber of commerce about a year ago. Police sources say he had relocated from Montreal. \\n \\n Another man, Dominic Bouffard, who works for the local paper, said Bain is a successful businessman who occasionally took out ads to promote his lodge. Bouffard said he tried hard to network with local politicians and business leaders. \\n \\n \\\"He did everything he could to meet people in the municipality, in the (Mont-Tremblant area), and everywhere,\\\" Bouffard said. \\n \\n --with files from Benjamin Shingler and Julien Arsenault. ||||| A historic Quebec election that returned the Parti Qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9cois to power ended in tragedy Tuesday when a gunman killed one person and wounded another, then tried to start a fire at the Montreal venue where PQ Leader Pauline Marois was celebrating her minority mandate. \\n \\n Police said a suspect entered a vestibule at the back of the Metropolis nightclub and fired shots, wounding two people critically. The suspect then started a fire and ran away on foot. \\n \\n One shooting victim, a 45-year-old man, died at the scene. At a 6 a.m. press conference Wednesday, Montreal police said the second shooting victim, 27, was no longer in danger. Ambulance services reported another person is in hospital suffering from shock. \\n \\n Montreal police spokesmen said they have arrested a 62-year-old man from Quebec, but not Montreal, who spoke French with an accent. The suspect has not been identified. Police have opened a homicide investigation and have seized two firearms. Suret\\u00e9 du Qu\\u00e9bec spokesman Guy Lapointe says police cannot rule out that Ms. Marois was the intended target. \\n \\n \\u201cThe English are waking up, the English are waking up ... It's payback ... Yeah, yeah, that\\u2019s enough,\\u201d the man said as police officers led him away in handcuffs. The suspect, a heavyset, bespectacled man, wore a balaclava, shorts and what appeared to be a bathrobe. \\n \\n [Editor's note: Comments were originally open on this story. However we have now closed comments for legal reasons following the arrest of a man after people were shot and a fire was set outside the PQ victory celebration. Readers can still access comments posted earlier by clicking here.] \\n \\n Ms. Marois was in the middle of her victory speech, after narrowly defeating Jean Charest\\u2019s Liberals by a handful of seats and about one percentage point in the popular vote, when several plainclothes police officers from her security detail suddenly burst on stage and pulled her away, shouting \\\"Go with us, madam!\\\" She later returned and spoke to the crowd. \\n \\n Earlier, Ms. Marois had acknowledged the ambivalence of Quebec voters in giving her a narrow minority mandate. \\n \\n \\\"We will respect that choice by governing with all the other elected lawmakers. We'll make the necessary compromises to make the state work ... We'll govern in a responsible way.\\\" \\n \\n Ms. Marois, who had been severely criticized for campaigning on identity and language themes, had some conciliatory words for Quebec's anglophone and native communities, speaking of their shared history and, in a rare move for her, speaking in English to say their rights would be respected. \\n \\n However, she struck a tougher stance towards the rest of Canada. \\n \\n \\\"As a nation, we want to take ourselves the decisions that affect us. We want a country. And we'll have it.\\\" \\n \\n Liberal Leader Jean Charest, the outgoing premier, lost in his riding, for the first time in a 28-year career that began when he was elected to Parliament on this day in 1984. \\n \\n \\\"The results of this election speaks to the fact the future of Quebec lies within Canada,\\\" he said. He also quipped that, \\\"I want to thank the activists of the Liberal party who once again proved the polls wrong.\\\" \\n \\n In his concession speech, Mr. Charest boasted that his party \\\"will leave the house in good order.\\\" \\n \\n Mr. Charest predicted that the Liberals would bounce back. Pointing an index up, he noted that there was \\\"one percentage point in the popular vote between us (and the PQ).\\\" \\n \\n He made no comments about his political future. A press conference is scheduled for Wednesday. \\n \\n In a statement issued early Wednesday by Prime Minister Stephen Harper\\u2019s office, he said: \\u201cWe are disturbed by this violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.\\u201d \\n \\n Earlier, Mr. Harper congratulated Ms. Marois \\u2014 then delivered a pointed barb aimed at the independence project. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t believe Quebeckers want to reopen the old constitutional quarrels of the past,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\n \\n \\u201cOur government will remain focused on jobs, economic growth and good economic management. We believe economic issues and jobs are also the priority of Quebeckers. In that sense, we will continue working with the Government of Quebec on those common objectives.\\u201d \\n \\n Report Typo/Error\",\n          \"Remains of major new prehistoric stone monument at Durrington Walls discovered The remains of a major new prehistoric stone monument have been discovered less than 3 kilometres from Stonehenge.

It was a fine English summer\\u2019s day, with thin, fast clouds above, and as we passed through fields dotted with buttercups and daisies, cows and sheep, we could have been hikers anywhere, were it not for the ghostly monument in the near distance. \\n \\n Faint as the Avenue was, Vince Gaffney hustled along as if it were illuminated by runway lights. A short, sprightly archaeologist of 56, from Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England, he knows this landscape as well as anyone alive: has walked it, breathed it, studied it for uncounted hours. He has not lost his sense of wonder. Stopping to fix the monument in his eyeline, and reaching out toward the stones on the horizon, he said, \\u201cLook, it becomes cathedralesque.\\u201d \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s latest research effort, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, is a four-year collaboration between a British team and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Austria that has produced the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding Stonehenge, totaling more than four square miles. The results are astonishing. The researchers have found buried evidence of more than 15 previously unknown or poorly understood late Neolithic monuments: henges, barrows, segmented ditches, pits. To Gaffney, these findings suggest a scale of activity around Stonehenge far beyond what was previously suspected. \\u201cThere was sort of this idea that Stonehenge sat in the middle and around it was effectively an area where people were probably excluded,\\u201d Gaffney told me, \\u201ca ring of the dead around a special area\\u2014to which few people might ever have been admitted....Perhaps there were priests, big men, whatever they were, inside Stonehenge having processions up the Avenue, doing...something extremely mysterious. Of course that sort of analysis depends on not knowing what\\u2019s actually in the area around Stonehenge itself. It was terra incognita, really.\\u201d \\n \\n Nobody has yet put a spade in the ground to verify the new findings, which were painstakingly gathered by geophysicists and others wielding magnetometers and ground-penetrating radars that scan the ground to detect structures and objects several yards below the surface. But Gaffney has no doubt of the work\\u2019s value. \\u201cThis is among the most important landscapes, and probably the most studied landscape, in the world,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey. Won\\u2019t be the same again.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n The joys and frustrations of all archaeological study\\u2014perhaps all historical inquiry\\u2014come into particularly sharp relief at Stonehenge. Even to the most casual observer, the monument is deeply significant. Those vast stones, standing in concentric rings in the middle of a basin on Salisbury Plain, carefully placed by who-knows-who thousands of years ago, must mean something. But nobody can tell us what. Not exactly. The clues that remain will always prove insufficient to our curiosity. Each archaeological advance yields more questions, and more theories to be tested. Our ignorance shrinks by fractions. What we know is always dwarfed by what we can never know. \\n \\n Take the big question: Was Stonehenge predominantly a temple, a parliament or a graveyard? Was it a healing ground? We don\\u2019t know, for sure. We know that people were buried there, and that the stones are aligned in astronomically important ways. We also understand, because of the chemical composition of animal bones found nearby and the provenance of the stones, that people traveled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge. But we cannot say, with certainty, why. \\n \\n Try a simpler question: How did the bluestones, which weigh between four and eight tons apiece, arrive at the site, nearly 5,000 years ago, from 170 miles away in West Wales? Land or sea? Both alternatives explode with possibilities, and nobody has an impregnable theory. Mike Parker Pearson of University College London is working on a new idea that the bluestones might have been lifted onto huge wooden lattices and carried by dozens of men to the site. But it\\u2019s just a theory. We can\\u2019t know, definitively. We can only have better-informed questions. \\n \\n The ineffability of Stonehenge has not dulled our appetite. The site has long proved irresistible to diggers. In 1620, the Duke of Buckingham had his men excavate right in the center of the monument. Although they did not know it at the time, they dug on the site of a prehistoric pit. Buckingham\\u2019s men found skulls of cattle \\u201cand other beasts\\u201d and large quantities of \\u201cburnt coals or charcoals\\u201d\\u2014but no treasure, as they had hoped. \\n \\n In the 19th century, \\u201cbarrow-digging,\\u201d or the excavation of prehistoric monuments and burial hills, was a popular pastime among the landed gentry. In 1839, a naval officer named Captain Beamish dug out an estimated 400 cubic feet of soil from the northeast of the Altar Stone at Stonehenge. As Parker Pearson notes in his book Stonehenge, Beamish\\u2019s \\u201cbig hole was probably the final blow for any prehistoric features...that once lay at Stonehenge\\u2019s center.\\u201d \\n \\n Work at Stonehenge became less invasive. In 1952, Willard Libby\\u2014the American chemist and later a Nobel Prize winner\\u2014used his new radiocarbon dating technique on a piece of charcoal from a pit within Stonehenge to date the monument to 1848 B.C., give or take 275 years. That date has since been refined several times. The prevailing opinion is that the first stones were erected on the site around 2600 B.C. (although the building of Stonehenge was carried out over a millennium, and there were centuries of ritual activity at the site before the stones were in place). \\n \\n In 2003, Parker Pearson conducted his own survey, concentrating on the nearby settlement at Durrington Walls and the area between there and the River Avon. Based on huts, tools and animal bones he uncovered, he concluded that Durrington Walls likely housed the workers who built Stonehenge. Based on an analysis of human remains he later excavated from Stonehenge, he also surmised that, far from being a site of quotidian religious activity, Stonehenge served as a cemetery\\u2013a \\u201cplace for the dead.\\u201d \\n \\n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is different from everything that came before it. When Gaffney and his team started their work, they were less interested in theories than in data. To that end, they concentrated on taking what amounts to a three-dimensional and yards-deep photograph of the entire landscape. \\u201cThe perceived wisdom was driven by the monuments we knew about,\\u201d says Gaffney. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve put in the data between the monuments.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n Chris Gaffney, Vince\\u2019s younger, slighter and less voluble brother, was one of the instigators of this new approach. The duo\\u2019s grandfather was a metalwork teacher from Newcastle with an interest in archaeology, who took his clever grandchildren on trips to Hadrian\\u2019s Wall, the old barrier between the Roman Empire and the blasted north. Small wonder that Vince became an archaeologist and Chris a geophysicist, now at the University of Bradford. \\n \\n The Gaffney brothers\\u2019 interest in new technologies that were becoming available to archaeologists led them to the first GPS-guided magnetometer systems. A magnetometer has sensors that allow a geophysicist to see evidence of historic building, and even ancient ditch-digging, beneath the soil by mapping variations in the earth\\u2019s magnetic field. The GPS-guided versions were able to pinpoint some of those discoveries to within one centimeter. The Gaffneys believed that Stonehenge scholarship needed a massive magnetometer- and radar-led survey of the whole site. \\u201cWe just didn\\u2019t know if anything\\u2019s there,\\u201d Vince Gaffney recalled. \\u201cSo we\\u2019re constructing various hypotheses on the basis of something we don\\u2019t know.\\u201d \\n \\n Around the same time, an Austrian archaeologist named Wolfgang Neubauer, now of the Boltzmann Institute, was hoping to conduct large-scale projects all over Europe using tools including GPS magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar. Neubauer\\u2019s team had also developed software to process the 40 or 50 gigabytes of raw data that these instruments could create in a day. Suddenly, instead of waiting weeks or months to see what the machines had found, it was possible to cover several acres with magnetometers and radar in a day and to display that information on a screen almost instantaneously. \\n \\n One of the areas Neubauer wanted to scan was Stonehenge, and in the spring of 2009 he contacted Vince Gaffney. A few months later, the Boltzmann Institute and the University of Birmingham\\u2014plus several other British and European universities, museums and companies that contributed expertise and resources\\u2014began their collaboration at Stonehenge. \\n \\n Their first days on site, Gaffney recalled, were \\u201clike a geophysical circus has come to town.\\u201d Tractors pushed the ground-penetrating radars, which looked like high-powered lawn mowers. All-terrain vehicles dragged the magnetometer sensors on long strings. Delicate instruments covering hard, uneven ground kept mechanics and technicians busy. \\u201cI have seen one of our magnetometers shear clear apart in front of me,\\u201d said Gaffney. \\u201cIt was back in service the next day.\\u201d In all, the fieldwork took about 120 days, spread over four years. \\n \\n *** \\n \\n In a multimedia room at the University of Birmingham there was a vast touch screen, six feet by nine, on which a new map of the Stonehenge landscape appeared. Gaffney pointed out the key features. \\n \\n There was Stonehenge itself, marked by the familiar circles. To the north was the long, thin strip called the Stonehenge Cursus or the Greater Cursus, which was demarcated by ditches, and ran east to west for nearly two miles. (The Cursus was given its name by the antiquarian William Stukeley in the 18th century because it looked like an ancient Roman race course. Its construction predates the first building work at Stonehenge by several hundred years.) Gaffney also pointed out the Cursus Barrows\\u2014hillocks containing mass human graves\\u2014just south of the Cursus itself, and King Barrow Ridge to the east. \\n \\n Scattered all over the map were blotches of black: features without names. These were new finds, including the more than 15 possible new or poorly understood Neolithic monuments. Gaffney emphasized possible, acknowledging that it will require digging\\u2014\\u201cthe testimony of the spade\\u201d\\u2014to discover precisely what was there. \\n \\n Standing in front of this constellation of evidence, he seemed unable to decide where to start, like a child at the Christmas tree. \\u201cThese are little henge monuments,\\u201d he said, touching the screen to highlight a group of black smudges. \\u201cNice little entrance there, and a ditch. These things we know nothing about.\\u201d \\n \\n He saved his greatest enthusiasm for the discoveries that had been made in the Cursus. This feature, said Gaffney, had always been thought of as a \\u201cbloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge.\\u201d Nobody knew quite what it was for. Because the Cursus runs east to west, archaeologists have always believed that its presence owes something to the passage of the sun. The monument must be significant: It was dug in the fourth millennium B.C. using antler picks\\u2014hundreds of thousands of man-hours went into its construction. \\n \\n The Hidden Landscapes Project\\u2019s instruments discovered several new clues. First of all, they found gaps in the ditch, in particular a very large break in the northern side, to allow people to enter and exit the Cursus. Now, instead of seeing the Cursus exclusively as a monument that encouraged movement along the path of the sun, east to west, Gaffney began to consider these gaps as \\u201cchannels through the landscape\\u201d to guide the movement of people north to south. \\n \\n A bigger discovery, Gaffney says, was a \\u201cbloody huge\\u201d pit about five yards in diameter at the eastern end of the Cursus. Today it lies buried at least three feet below the surface of the ground. Such a pit was much too large for a practical use\\u2014for instance, burying trash\\u2014because of the labor involved in digging it. In the archaeologists\\u2019 minds it could only have ritual implications, as \\u201ca marker of some kind,\\u201d Gaffney said. What\\u2019s more, if you drew a straight line between the pit and the heelstone at Stonehenge, it ran directly along the final section of the Avenue, on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice. \\n \\n \\u201cWe thought, That\\u2019s a bit of a coincidence!\\u201d Gaffney recalled. \\u201cThat was the point at which we thought, What\\u2019s at the other end? And there\\u2019s another pit! Two pits, marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice, set within a monument that\\u2019s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun.\\u201d \\n \\n With his hands passing over the map, Gaffney showed how\\u2014on the longest days of the year\\u2014the pits formed a triangle with Stonehenge marking sunrise and sunset. \\n \\n \\u201cNobody had ever seen these pits before,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut they link the area of Stonehenge with the Cursus directly. Either these things have been put inside the Cursus to mark these points, or the Cursus has been wrapped around them.\\u201d \\n \\n What was so interesting about the Cursus pits was that they told a story about the landscape. The \\u201csunrise\\u201d pit was visible from Stonehenge, but the \\u201csunset\\u201d pit was not\\u2014it was nestled behind a ridge, and could have been seen only if there had been fire and smoke coming from it. (At some point the pits will have to be excavated for evidence of such activity.) These discoveries fed into a larger understanding of Stonehenge as \\u201cdiachronic\\u201d\\u2014operating in light and dark, sunrise and sunset, day and night. \\n \\n \\u201cThe point I think we\\u2019re coming to,\\u201d said Gaffney, \\u201cis that increasingly we can see the area around Stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement\\u2014which we can now understand, largely because we know where things are.\\u201d \\n \\n Parker Pearson, for his part, takes a cautious view of the new research. \\u201cUntil you dig holes, you just don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019ve got,\\u201d he told me in his office at University College London. \\u201cWhat date it is, how significant it is. [There are] extraordinary new features coming up, and we\\u2019re thinking well, what are they?\\u201d \\n \\n To be sure, he said the data from the Hidden Landscapes Project \\u201cbacks up the pattern we\\u2019ve already been seeing for some years. We have an excessive number of solstice-aligned monuments in that landscape. Nowhere in the rest of Europe comes even close.\\u201d He added, \\u201cThis is fantastic stuff that\\u2019s been done, and it\\u2019s raised a whole series of new questions,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to take years.\\u201d \\n \\n *** \\n \\n The clouds shifted in front of the sun, dappling the landscape with shadow. Gaffney and I were walking the Avenue, 300 yards or so from Stonehenge, and in the distance a string of barrows gleamed like opals. Although he acknowledged the fallibility of all archaeological projection (\\u201cIn the end,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwe are all wrong\\u201d), his work has led him to a new interpretation of how Stonehenge was used. \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s idea was not to focus on Stonehenge itself, but on \\u201cprocessionality\\u201d within the whole landscape. He imagined people moving around the area like Roman Catholics processing through the Stations of the Cross. He recalled an Easter Friday ritual he saw in Croatia, in which a \\u201cbloke with a cross\\u201d led fellow barefoot celebrants on a miles-long trip. In Gaffney\\u2019s view, the building of the great stone circle was a \\u201cmonumentalizing\\u201d of a similar, if heathen, procession. \\n \\n As we walked downhill through the fields, Gaffney stopped from time to time to point out the hillocks in which \\u201cthe illustrious dead\\u201d were buried. He also noted how the Avenue was not a straight line between the Avon and Stonehenge, but rather a series of tacks that brought the visitor to the Stonehenge site in a \\u201ctheatrical\\u201d way, along the line of sunrise on the summer solstice. \\n \\n He thrust himself into the mind of a Bronze Age visitor to the site. \\u201cYou will have seen nothing like it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt would have been massively impressive.\\u201d Soon we descended into a valley called Stonehenge Bottom, only a hundred yards or so from the great stones. \\u201cThey\\u2019re disappearing....Watch, just watch!\\u201d he said. \\n \\n Within a few yards, the monument became invisible. When you picture Stonehenge in your mind\\u2019s eye, you imagine the concentric rings of vast stones standing in a desolate open landscape, visible for miles around. But now, here we were, a hundred yards away, and the thing had gone. \\n \\n We stood in a field, watched by some lethargic cows, and savored the strangeness of the moment. Then, as we stepped uphill, Stonehenge re-emerged on the horizon. It happened fast. The lintels, then the great sarsens, then the smaller bluestones were suddenly before us. \\n \\n Gaffney\\u2019s voice lifted. He spoke about Jerusalem Syndrome: the feeling of intense emotion experienced by pilgrims on their first sighting of the Holy City. In the prehistoric world, there was no conception of God as he was understood by the later Abrahamic faiths. But, said Gaffney, as Stonehenge reappeared before us, \\u201cwhatever the ancient version of Jerusalem Syndrome is, that\\u2019s what you\\u2019re feeling now.\\u201d ||||| The mysteries of Stonehenge are revealed sometimes by unusual methods\\u2014forgetting to water its grass or whacking its stones with quartz.

[Financial Times, The Independent, Nature] \\n \\n Top image: donsimon/shutterstock ||||| Ludwig Boltzmann Institute \\n \\n Every summer solstice, tens of thousands of people throng to Stonehenge, creating a festival-like atmosphere at the 4,400-year-old stone monument. For the 2015 solstice, they will have a bit more room to spread out.
